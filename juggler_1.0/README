2. Questions about VR Juggler
==============================================================================

    As with most open source projects, there is a common path to follow
    for getting answers to questions.  The first step is to look at the
    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page on the web site.  If you do
    not find an answer there, refer to the detailed documentation.  If
    that too fails, send your question to the appropriate mailing list
    to get an answer from someone else in the VR Juggler community.
