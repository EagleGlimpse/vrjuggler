                    ADDENDUM TO LICENSE 
                       December 2011

                    Copyright (C) 2011

Everyone is permitted to create and distribute verbatim copies of this
license addendum document, but changing it is not allowed.

VR Juggler License Addendum:

0. VR Juggler ("The Library") is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public
   License as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 2.1 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version, with the following
   additional conditions.  The following conditions take precedence over
   any conditions or restrictions stipulated by the Lesser General Public
   License insofar as a conflict exists.

1. The VR Juggler License Agreement ("License") covers only VR Juggler
   ("The Library").  Other libraries which the Library may use are covered
   by their own respective licenses.

2. Statically linking of a copy of the Library against any work using
   the Library, i.e. the inclusion of (parts of) the Library into a program
   or binary, is functionally equivalent to a work using the Library by
   linking to it dynamically, and therefore does not constitute creating
   a modified or derivative work based on the Library.

   This specifically extends paragraph 5 of the GNU Lesser General Public
   License to allow for inclusion of code in excess of 10 lines in length.
   There is no limit on the length of the code segements that are statically
   linked into an application.  This clause is meant to allow for the use
   of large inline methods, templated code, and template meta programs.

3. Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of the GNU
   Lesser General Public License. Any executables containing that work
   also may be distributed under the Lesser General Public License
   whether or not if they are linked directly with the Library itself.

4. Programs or binaries linked with the Library must be identified as
   such by including, in the Documentation or by other means (for example
   in the About Box or Online Help), the following statement:

   "This software uses VR Juggler (http://www.vrjuggler.org/)."

5. Modifications to the configure scripts, config header files, and makefiles
   by themselves to support a specific platform do not constitute a modified
   or derivative work.

   The authors do request that such modifications be contributed to the
   VR Juggler project through the VR Juggler issue tracker on the following
   page:

      http://code.google.com/p/vrjuggler/issues/list

6. Application objects and device drivers that are subclassed from Juggler
   classes do not constitute a derivative work.
