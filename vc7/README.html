<h1>Set Environment Variables</h1>

<p>
Prior to starting the Visual Studio GUI, several environment variables
must be set.  These variables provide paths to external dependencies of
the Juggler source code.  There are some environment variables that are
required for successful compilation of the Juggler source, and there are
some that are optional for getting additional code to compile.
</p>

<h2>Required Environment Variables</h2>

<p>
The required environment variables are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>BOOST_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an installed copy of
    <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> 1.31.0 or newer.  This must
    contain a directory named <tt>lib</tt> that contains <i>at least</i>
    compiled versions of the Boost.Filesystem library.  Refer to the relevant
    <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html#Build_Install">Boost
    documentation</a> for instructions on how to get and install Boost.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>BOOST_INCLUDES</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The directory containing the root of the Boost header tree.  For a
    Boost 1.31.0 installation, this will normally be set to the value of
    <tt>%BOOST_ROOT%\include\boost-1_31</tt>.  The requirement here is
    that the value of this environment variable must be the full path to
    a directory that contains a sub-directory named <tt>boost</tt>, in
    which the Boost headers will be found.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>BOOST_TOOL</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The name of the Boost Jam toolset used to compile Boost.  This will
    be either <tt>vc7</tt> or <tt>vc7.1</tt> depending on how Boost was
    compiled.  To figure out for sure which was used, look at the names
    of the libraries in <tt>%BOOST_ROOT%\lib</tt>.  For example, the
    name of the Boost.Filesystem DLL may be
    <tt>boost_filesystem-<b>vc7</b>-mt-1_31.dll</tt> where the
    <tt>vc7</tt> part of the file name indicates that it was compiled
    using the <tt>vc7</tt> toolset.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>BOOST_VERSION</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The version of Boost against which the Juggler code will be compiled.
    However, this string must use underscores (<tt>_</tt>) instead of
    periods (<tt>.</tt>), and it should only reference the major and
    minor version number.  For example, if you are compiling against Boost
    1.31.2, this environment variable would be set to <tt>1_31</tt>.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>NSPR_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an installed copy of
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/">NSPR</a> 4.2 or newer.
    This must contain a directory named <tt>lib</tt> and a directory
    named <tt>include</tt>.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>CPPDOM_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an installed copy of
    <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/xml-cppdom/">CppDOM</a>
    0.3.0 or newer.  This must contain a directory named <tt>lib</tt> and a
    directory named <tt>include</tt>.  Within <tt>lib</tt>, there must be
    directories named <tt>Debug</tt>, <tt>DebugDLL</tt>, <tt>Release</tt>,
    and <tt>ReleaseDLL</tt>.  Each of these contains one build of the CppDOM
    library that reflects the name of the containing directory.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Optional Environment Variables</h2>

<p>
The optional environment variables are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>OMNIORB_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of an
    <a href="http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/">omniORB</a> 4.0.x installation.
    This directory must contain the sub-directories <tt>bin</tt>,
    <tt>include</tt>, and <tt>lib</tt>.  In <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>lib</tt>,
    there must be sub-directories named <tt>x86_win32</tt> that contain the
    actual compiled binaries.  This is the normal directory structure seen
    after omniORB is compiled successfully.
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>VRPN_ROOT</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    The root directory of a
    <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/vrpn/">VRPN</a> 6.04 or newer
    tree.  This directory must contain the sub-directories <tt>quat</tt>
    and <tt>vrpn</tt>.  In each of those, there must be a sub-directory
    named <tt>pc_win32</tt>, and within it, there must be sub-directories
    named <tt>Debug</tt> and <tt>Release</tt>.  These contain the compiled
    version of the appropriate library.  This is the normal directory
    structure seen after VRPN is compiled successfully.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h1>Running Visual Studio</h1>

<p>
Once the environment variables are set, double-click on <tt>Juggler.sln</tt>
or load that file into the Visual Studio GUI.  The chosen target should
be either "Debug DLL" or "Release DLL".  Otherwise, select "Batch Build"
and compile everything selected.  By default, the static versions of the
libraries will not be compiled.
