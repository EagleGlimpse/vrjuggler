	<b><a name="WhatIs">What is VR Juggler?</a></b>
		<p>VR Juggler is a C++ class library that is used as a framework for application
		development.&nbsp; VR Juggler controls the low level aspects of the system that the user
		application is executing on.&nbsp; It provides a generic interface to common input and
		output devices that VR Juggler can control</p>

		<p>VR Juggler controls:</p>
		<UL>
		      <LI>Graphics rendering</LI>
		      <LI>VR devices</LI>
		      <LI>Graphic projection setup</LI>
		      <LI>Multi-processing</LI>
		      <LI>Process synchronization</LI>
		</UL>
		
	<b><a name="WhatIsNot">What VR Juggler is not</a></b>
		<p>VR Juggler does not have it's own graphics API. It requires you to use a standard API such as OpenGL.
		VR Juggler does not have any support for scene graphs or other data structures for the application graphics.
		VR Juggler is not a visual development environment.</p>
	
	<b><a name="getstarted">Great, where do I begin?</a></b>
		<p>To begin, we suggest reading one of Juggler's books called the "Programmer Guide".  
		You'll find this book in the tree control on the www.vrjuggler.org web site.  
		In the tree control the path to getting started is: "Documentation"/"Programmer Guide"/"Getting Started"</p><BR>
	
   <b><a name="whatdoineed">What do I need to run juggler?</a></b>
		<p>For a very specific answer to this question, check out the downloads page.  There will be requirements next to each juggler distribution.  Generally you will need OpenGL or Performer as your image generator.  Juggler will run by itself otherwise (you will not need any other display driver such as CAVElib, or WTK). </p><BR> 
      
    <b><a name="compilejugglerwin32">How do I compile the juggler source code under Win32?</a></b>
		<p>You really don't need to do this, unless you plan to modify the code and submit the changes to us.  You can find binaries for Win32 on our downloads page.  <BR>
      To compile the source code to Juggler on win32 platforms, you will want to download <a target="${NEW_WINDOW}" href="${GETCYGWIN}">Cygnus's set of UNIX tools</a>, and <a target="${NEW_WINDOW}" href="${GETAUTOCONF}">GNU Autoconf</a>.<BR>
      You can find detailed information about all of this in "Documentation"/"Juggler Team Guide"/"Build Systems"/Juggler/"<A HREF="${TEAMGUIDE}/build/juggler/win32.caveats.html">Win32 Caveats</A>"
      of the Juggler Team Guide (book) on our web site.</p>

<h3><a name="vjcontrolDoesntRun">VjControl</a></h3>
   <blockquote>
	<li><b>Why doesn't VjControl run?</b><BR>
	    Prior to the release of VR Juggler 0.1.97, VjControl would
	    work with Java 1.1 provided that the Java Swing classes were
	    available in a file called <TT>swingall.jar</TT>.  VjControl
	    purposely ignores your <TT>CLASSPATH</TT> environment variable,
	    so with the old releases we recommend that you place
	    <TT>swingall.jar</TT> file into your <TT>bin</TT> directory
	    along with the <TT>vjcontrol</TT> or <TT>vjcontrol1.1</TT>
	    executable.  Since VR Juggler 0.1.97, VjControl <I>only</I>
	    works with Java 2 or newer (JDK versions 1.2 and higher).
	    Because of this, <TT>swingall.jar</TT> is no longer needed.

	    <P>

	    Another possibility is that you do not have the
	    <TT>VJ_BASE_DIR</TT> environment variable set.  Setting this
	    variable is <I>required</I> to run VjControl because the
	    shell script (or batch file on Win32) needs to be able to
	    find the file <TT>VjControl.jar</TT> which is always located
	    in <TT>VJ_BASE_DIR/bin</TT> with the <TT>vjcontrol</TT> script
	    and <TT>vjcontrol.bat</TT> batch file.  Refer to the
	    documentation describing
	    <A HREF="${PROGRAMMERGUIDE}/getting.started/User.Setup/environment.variables.html">environment
	    variables</A> for more information.  It explains all the
	    environment variables related to VR Juggler (and VjControl).
	</li>
	<LI><B>What's <TT>swingall.jar</TT>?</B><BR>
	  The file <TT>swingall.jar</TT> contains the Swing classes that
	  are part of the Java 2 distribution.  These classes were need to
	  use Swing with Java 1.1.  You may need to install the Java Swing
	  distribution from
	  <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/" TARGET="_top">Sun</A>.  After you do
	  that, find the file <TT>swingall.jar</TT> (in the Java installed
	  location), and copy it to the same place as where the
	  <TT>vjcontrol</TT> executable is (usually in
	  <TT>VJ_BASE_DIR/bin</TT>).

      <A NAME="head_wand"><B>Why is there a blue sphere and a green cone in
      my way when I run in simulator mode?</B></A>

      <P>
	When you run in simulator mode, typically there will be VR Juggler
	simulator displays open showing the 3D space you are simulating.
	These are a special type of VR Juggler display.  Instead of basing
	its viewpoint on the head position of one of the users, the
	viewpoint is controlled by a separate ``camera'' that is just
	another positional device.  The Sim Display also draws certain
	objects to help visualize the environment.  For example, the heads
	of users are represented as blue spheres with gray eyes, and a wand
	(if present) is drawn as a green cone.  These are seen <I>only</I>
	in simulator displays and are there to help you if you are doing
	development using the simulator environment.
      </P>

	<a name="cavelib2dxform"><li><b>I'm a CAVELib user that's trying to learn VRJuggler for a new project.  Is
   there an easy way to setup a 2d projection on the walls?  In Cavelib
   you'd do a CAVEWallTransform which puts you in a 2d projection on the
   current wall so you can do 2d overlay stuff (Disable Lights & depth test,
   then a lot of glVertex2f).  Something similar to this would be nice, but
   any way is welcome.<BR><BR>
   Also, is there a way to tell which wall you're drawing on?  No need
   drawing the overlay on all of them, after all.</b><BR></a>

   This is OpenGL specific... Turn off the depth buffer testing, and then draw your 3d geometry at the
   same position that the wall is at.  Make sure you draw it last too.  Also,
   don't transform the geometry with your navigation matrix.  <BR><BR>

   You will know what wall you're drawing on, by the position of your
   geometry.<BR><BR>

   This way, you wont have to do any thing weird or morally wrong, like draw 
   2D in a 3D VR environment.  Personally though, I wouldn't ever draw just
   on one wall, since technically the user isn't supposed to know the walls  
   are there (thats what we call immersion).  It could ruin the effect for   
   them. I'd just put it up somewhere convenient in 3D space (if that 
   happens to be the wall, then I wouldn't let that stop me. :).   <BR><BR> 

   The depth buffer trick will ensure that you'll always see it, but
   be careful - since it can really confuse your users if something gets
   positioned in front of your head up display... since your HUD would be the
   thing drawn on top (physically impossible).<BR><BR>

	<a name="portingcaveapps"><li><b>How do I port a CAVElib application to Juggler?  
   Or please summerize a Juggler application so I can better understand how to port my app.</b></a><BR><BR>

   The sample code and header for vjGlApp illustrates this, but here's an overview:<BR><BR>

   in a juggler vjApp class, there are 5 functions which you'll find
   immediately important, one for initialization, one for drawing (opengl
   only), and two for computation (I usually use only one of these).<BR><BR>

   the 2 init functions are called once on execution of the application.<BR>
   1.) init<BR>
   2.) contextInit (called once per window)<BR><BR>

   The other 3 are called repeatedly in this order:<BR><BR>

   3.) preFrame<BR>
   4.) draw      (Called once per open window...
                  Function is threaded,
                  so may be called during pre or postFrame)<BR>
   5.) postFrame<BR><BR><BR>


   a.) Initialize your data in init.<BR><BR>

   b.) Initialize your display contexts and texture objects in contextInit you
   will need to keep track of the ID/index per graphics window. vjContextData
   may help you out with this...<BR><BR>

   c.) Do your computations (like modifying your data with juggler input devices
   etc..) in preFrame and/or postFrame.<BR><BR>

   d.) Don't do your computations in draw, just read your current data state, and
   draw (render) it.  If you have display lists or texture objects, you will
   need to keep track of the ID/index per graphics window and call them
   accordingly.<BR><BR><BR>


   NOTE: that draw is threaded, so may be called during pre or postFrame.
         contextInit is similar.<BR><BR><BR>


   Hope this gives you a better Idea of what is happening in your juggler/opengl application.<BR>

	  <P>
	    In general, different <A HREF="${GLOSSARY}#platform">platforms</A>
	    have different development environments.  It is very difficult
	    to guarantee that a compiler will behave exactly the same
	    between two different platforms.  This is especially true when
	    moving from a Win32 environment to a version of UNIX or vice
	    versa.  The sample applications shipped with VR Juggler binary
	    distributions all have their own makefile (unsurprisingly named
	    <TT>Makefile</TT>) that was generated for use on the specific
	    platform where VR Juggler was compiled.  The fifth line of these
	    files names this platform.  This information is there to tell
	    you where you can expect the makefile to work.
	  </P>

	  <P>
	    If you have based your application's makefile on one of these
	    samples, you should expect to do some work to get your
	    application to build on another platform.  While the code will
	    not have to change (ideally), the way the compiling works
	    probably will change.  That is just a fact of life when
	    working with multiple platforms.  While it is theoretically
	    possible to use the same single makefile on many different
	    platforms, VR Juggler does not offer such a solution.  That is
	    most definitely not the scope of the VR Juggler project.
