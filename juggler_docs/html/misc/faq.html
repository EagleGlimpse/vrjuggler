	where you will find a FAQ on the menu to the left.  Submit any new
	questions, or any solutions you've found that are useful to
	<a href="${MAILTO_JUGGLER_MAILING_LIST}">the user mail list</a>.

	<P> </P>
      </DD>

    <DT><a name="anyapps"><b>Are there any applications (other than the
	demos) that can be downloaded for VR Juggler?</b></a>
      <DD>
	Not yet, but we will take submissions!  You could become famous with
	your cool app! <a href="${CONTACT_US_DIRECTLY}">Mail it to us.</a>

	<P> </P>
      </DD>

    <DT><a name="WhatIs"><b>What is VR Juggler?</b></a>
      <DD>
	VR Juggler is a C++ class library that is used as a framework for
	application development.  VR Juggler controls the low-level
	aspects of the system on which the user application is executing.
	It provides a generic interface to common input and output devices
	that VR Juggler can control.  VR Juggler controls the following:

	<UL>
	  <LI>Graphics rendering</LI>
	  <LI>VR devices</LI>
	  <LI>Graphic projection setup</LI>
	  <LI>Multi-processing</LI>
	  <LI>Process synchronization</LI>
	</UL>

	<P> </P>
      </DD>

    <DT><a name="WhatIsNot"><b>What VR Juggler is not?</b></a>
      <DD>
	VR Juggler does not have its own graphics API.  It requires you
	to use a standard API such as OpenGL.  VR Juggler does not have
	any support for scenegraphs or other data structures for the
	application graphics.  VR Juggler is not a visual development
	environment.

	<P> </P>
      </DD>

    <DT><a name="getstarted"><b>Great, where do I begin?</b></a>
      <DD>
	To begin, we suggest reading one of VR Juggler's books called
	the <I>Getting Started Guide</I>.  You'll find this book in the
	tree control on the
	<A HREF="http://www..vrjuggler.org/">www.vrjuggler.org</A>
	website.  In the tree control the path to getting started is:
	``Documentation''/``<A HREF="${GETTINGSTARTED}">Getting Started</A>''.

	<P> </P>
      </DD>

    <DT><a name="whatdoineed"><b>What do I need to run a VR Juggler
	application?</b></a>
      <DD>
	For a very specific answer to this question, check out the
	<A HREF="${DOWNLOAD}">downloads page</A>.  There will be requirements
	next to each VR Juggler distribution.  Generally you will need
	OpenGL or Performer as your image generator.  VR Juggler will run by
	itself otherwise (you will not need any other display driver such
	as CAVElib, or WTK).

	<P> </P>
      </DD>

    <DT><a name="supported_compilers"><b>What C++ compilers are
	supported?</b></a>
      <DD>
	The following lists supported platforms and the compilers that
	we use in developing and distributing versions of VR Juggler for
	those platforms:

	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    <B>IRIX</B>: we require the MIPSpro Compilers, version 7.3.1.1m
	    or higher and the associated STL implementation.  Previous
	    versions had bugs that caused VR Juggler to crash.
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    <B>Win32</B>: we only support Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 with
	    Service Pack 4.  You can use Service Pack 3, but it is recommended
	    that you upgrade if possible.  There have been reports of VR
	    Juggler compiling with Visual C++ 5.0, but we do not officially
	    support that version.
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    <B>Other platforms</B>: we support the latest versions of GCC
	    only.  You must use at least GCC 2.91 (EGCS 1.1.2) or a newer
	    version.  GCC 2.95.2 is recommended if it is available to you.
	    When GCC 3.0 is released, we will only support that version.
	  </LI>
	</UL>

	If you do not have the supported compiler for your operating
	system, we will be limited in how much we can help you.

	<P> </P>
      </DD>

    <DT><a name="compilejugglerwin32"><b>How do I compile the VR Juggler
	source code under Win32?</b></a>
      <DD>
	You really don't need to do this unless you plan to modify the
	code and submit the changes to us.  You can find precompiled binaries
	for Win32 on our <A HREF="${DOWNLOAD}">downloads page</A>.

	<P>

	To compile the source code to VR Juggler on Win32 platforms, you
	will want to download
	<a target="${NEW_WINDOW}" href="${GETCYGWIN}">Cygnus' set of UNIX
	tools</a> including Perl 5.6.1,
	<a target="${NEW_WINDOW}" href="${GETAUTOCONF}">GNU Autoconf</a>, and

<h3><a name="VjControl">VjControl</a></h3>
   <DL>
    <DT><A NAME="vjcontrolDoesntRun"><b>Why doesn't VjControl run?</b></A>
      <DD>
	Prior to the release of VR Juggler 0.1.97, VjControl would work
	with Java 1.1 provided that the Java Swing classes were available
	in a JAR file called <TT>swingall.jar</TT>.  VjControl purposely
	ignores your <TT>$CLASSPATH</TT> environment variable, so with the
	old releases we recommend that you place <TT>swingall.jar</TT>
	file into your <TT>bin</TT> directory along with the
	<TT>vjcontrol</TT> or <TT>vjcontrol1.1</TT> executable.  Since VR
	Juggler 0.1.97, VjControl <I>only</I> works with Java 2 or newer
	(JDK versions 1.2 and higher).  Because of this,
	<TT>swingall.jar</TT> is no longer needed.

	<P>

	Another possibility is that you do not have the <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR</TT>
	<A HREF="${GLOSSARY}#environment_variable">environment variable</A>
	set.  Setting this variable is <I>required</I> to run VjControl
	because the shell script (or batch file on Win32) needs to be able
	to find the file <TT>VjControl.jar</TT> which is always located
	in <TT>VJ_BASE_DIR/bin</TT> with the <TT>vjcontrol</TT> script and
	<TT>vjcontrol.bat</TT> batch file.  Refer to the documentation
	describing
	<A HREF="${GETTINGSTARTED}/environment.variables.html">environment
	variables</A> for more information.  It explains all the
	environment variables related to VR Juggler (and VjControl).

	<P> </P>
      </DD>

    <DT><A NAME="swingall-jar"><B>What's <TT>swingall.jar</TT>?</B></A>
      <DD>
	The file <TT>swingall.jar</TT> contains the Swing classes that
	are part of the Java 2 distribution.  These classes were need to
	use Swing with Java 1.1.  You may need to install the Java Swing
	distribution from
	<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/" TARGET="_top">Sun</A>.  After you do
	that, find the file <TT>swingall.jar</TT> (in the Java installed
	location), and copy it to the same place as where the
	<TT>vjcontrol</TT> executable is (usually in
	<TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/bin</TT>).

<h3><a name="applications">VR applications</a></h3>

  <DL>
    <DT><A NAME="sproc_pthread"><B>When I run on IRIX, the application hangs
        right after printing ``New application set''</B></A>
      <DD>
        This most often happens when using the IRIX SPROC version of VR
        Juggler and linking the POSIX thread library (libpthread) into
        the application.  When you compile your VR Juggler application,
        make sure not to use <TT>-lpthread</TT>.  If your application
        requires POSIX threads, use the pthread version of VR Juggler
        instead.

        <P>
        On IRIX, there are two ways to write multithreaded softare, and VR
        Juggler supports both.  The methods are IRIX SPROC and POSIX threads.
        These two systems are incompatible, and a SPROC application will
        hang the first time it tries to createa thread if the POSIX thread
        library is linked.  Removing <TT>-lpthread</TT> fixes the problem.

    <DT><A NAME="head_wand"><B>Why is there a blue sphere and a green cone
	in my way when I run in simulator mode?</B></A>
      <DD>
	When you run in simulator mode, typically there will be VR Juggler
	simulator displays open showing the 3D space you are simulating.
	These are a special type of VR Juggler display.  Instead of basing
	its viewpoint on the head position of one of the users, the
	viewpoint is controlled by a separate ``camera'' that is just
	another positional device.  The Sim Display also draws certain
	objects to help visualize the environment.  For example, the heads
	of users are represented as blue spheres with gray eyes, and a wand
	(if present) is drawn as a green cone.  These are seen <I>only</I>
	in simulator displays and are there to help you if you are doing
	development using the simulator environment.

      </DD>

    <DT><a name="cavelib2dxform"><b>I'm a CAVELib user that's trying to
	learn VR Juggler for a new project.  Is there an easy way to setup
	a 2D projection on the walls?  In CAVElib you'd do a
	CAVEWallTransform which puts you in a 2d projection on the current
	wall so you can do 2D overlay stuff (Disable Lights & depth test,
	then a lot of glVertex2f).  Something similar to this would be nice,
	but any way is welcome.  Also, is there a way to tell which wall
	you're drawing on?  No need drawing the overlay on all of them,
	after all.</b></a>
      <DD>
	This is OpenGL specific.  Turn off the depth buffer testing, and
	then draw your 3D geometry at the same position that the wall is
	at.  Make sure you draw it last too.  Also, don't transform the
	geometry with your navigation matrix.

	<P>

	You will know what wall you're drawing on, by the position of your
	geometry.

	<P>

	This way, you won't have to do any thing weird or morally wrong,
	like draw 2D in a 3D VR environment.  Personally though, I
	wouldn't ever draw just on one wall, since technically the user
	isn't supposed to know the walls  are there (thats what we call
	immersion).  It could ruin the effect for them. I'd just put it
	up somewhere convenient in 3D space (if that happens to be the
	wall, then I wouldn't let that stop me. :).

	<P>

	The depth buffer trick will ensure that you'll always see it, but
	be careful since it can really confuse your users if something gets
	positioned in front of your head up display... since your HUD would
	be the thing drawn on top (physically impossible).

   2.) Otherwise, here's a quick overview:

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	  <P>
	    In a VR Juggler vjApp class, there are 5 functions which you'll
	    find immediately important: one for initialization, one for
	    drawing (OpenGL only), and two for computation (I usually use
	    only one of these).
	  </P>

	  <P>
	    The two initializationfunctions are called once on execution of
	    the application:
	  </P>

	  <OL>
	    <LI>
	      <TT>init()</TT>
	    </LI>
	    <LI>
	      <TT>contextInit()</TT> (called once per window/graphics
	      context)
	    </LI>
	  </OL>

	  <P>
	    The other three are called repeatedly in this order:
	  </P>

	  <OL>
	    <LI>
	      <TT>preFrame()</TT>
	    </LI>
	    <LI>

	    </LI>
	    <LI>
	      <TT>postFrame()</TT>
	    </LI>
	  </OL>

	  <P>
	    These are the conceptual steps your application will take and
	    should thus influence the structure of your application:
	  </P>

	  <OL>
	    <LI>
	      Initialize your data in <TT>init()</TT>.
	    </LI>
	    <LI>
	      Initialize your display contexts and texture objects in
	      <TT>contextInit()</TT>.  You will need to keep track of the
	      ID/index per graphics window.  The <TT>vjContextData</TT>
	      class will help you with this.
	    </LI>
	    <LI>
	      Do your computations (such as modifying your data with VR
	      Juggler input devices) in <TT>preFrame()</TT> and/or
	      <TT>postFrame()</TT>.
	    </LI>
	    <LI>
	      Don't do your computations in draw.  Instead, just read your
	      current data state, and draw (render) it.  If you have
	      display lists or texture objects, you will need to keep
	      track of the ID/index per graphics window and call them
	      accordingly.
	    </LI>
	  </OL>

	  <P>
	    Note that <TT>draw()</TT> is threaded, so may be called during

      <DD>
	VR Juggler depends on the C++ compiler implementing the latest
	C++ standard.  This is especially true in the case of Standard
	Template Library support.  The latest VR Juggler code also uses
	the standard <TT>iostream</TT> classes (part of the <TT>std</TT>
	namespace).  If your compiler does not support these features,
	it cannot be used to compile VR Juggler or any VR Juggler
	applications.  Make sure that you are using one of the supported

   <DT><a name="edge-trigger"><B>When mouse/wand clicks are setup to register as digital button presses it is hard to get just one click</B></a>

	You'll want to look at <a href="${MISC}/glossary.html#edge-triggering">edge triggering</a> on vjDigital devices..
An edge trigger gives you 4 states.  On, Off, Just_On, Just_Off
VRJuggler digital devices do edge triggering for you automatically.
You'll want to test for Just_On, so that your presses don't keep
retriggering.
For example, you can test for if (vjDigital::TOGGLE_ON == vjDigitalProxy::getData() )
to see when the button is first pressed.

	  The most common reason for this is that you did not set the
	  <A HREF="${GETTINGSTARTED}/environment.variables.html">environment
	  variable</A> <TT>VJ_BASE_DIR</TT>.  This is <I>required</I> for
	  compiling as well as running because the makefiles for the
	  shipped sample applications reference <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR</TT> when
	  telling the compiler where to look for files.

	<DD>
	  In general, different <A HREF="${GLOSSARY}#platform">platforms</A>
	  have different development environments.  It is very difficult
	  to guarantee that a compiler will behave exactly the same
	  between two different platforms.  This is especially true when
	  moving from a Win32 environment to a version of UNIX or vice
	  versa.  The sample applications shipped with VR Juggler binary
	  distributions all have their own makefile (unsurprisingly named
	  <TT>Makefile</TT>) that was generated for use on the specific
	  platform where VR Juggler was compiled.  The fifth line of these
	  files names this platform.  This information is there to tell
	  you where you can expect the makefile to work.

	  <P>

	  If you have based your application's makefile on one of these
	  samples, you should expect to do some work to get your
	  application to build on another platform.  While the code will
	  not have to change (ideally), the way the compiling works
	  probably will change.  That is just a fact of life when working
	  with multiple platforms.  While it is theoretically possible to
	  use the same single makefile on many different platforms, VR
	  Juggler does not offer such a solution.  That is most definitely
	  not within the scope of the VR Juggler project.

	  An old version of Juggler had a pfDisable in its

	  Maybe you aren't using the <TT>-O</TT> option to your

	<DD>
	  Some SGI systems, specifically those using the MIPSpro Compiler
	  version 7.3, need another directory added to the
	  <TT>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> environmental variable.  It can be set
	  as follows:

<PRE>
    % <B>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib:/usr/lib32/cmplrs</B>
</PRE>

	  You'll need to set this if your compiler reports it has trouble
	  finding the file <TT>be.so</TT>.
