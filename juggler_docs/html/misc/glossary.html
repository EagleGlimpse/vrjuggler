<h3><a name="c">[C]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="compiler"><B>compiler</B> - A program that converts another
    program from some source language (or programming language) to machine
    language (object code). Some compilers output assembly language which
    is then converted to machine language by a separate assembler.
  </P>

  <P>
    <A NAME="context data"><B>context data</B> - OpenGL state information is associated with
    a GL graphics window, or more generally, a <a href="${GLOSSARY}#display context">display context</a>. 
    Compiled OpenGL commands such as displaylists do not get shared across muiltiple
    contexts (or windows) so you will need to initialize them once per window.  
    For example, if you were to try to call a display list created on a context that is not currently active, then your application will likely fail or do unexpected things.
    <BR><BR>
    This data that is only valid within its context, is referred to as context specific data.  
  </P>

<h3><a name="d">[D]</a></h3>
   <P>
    <A NAME="display context"><B>display context</B> - A display context is the current place graphics commands render to.  
    For example a display context can be the window on your screen that OpenGL renders to.  In more complex applications such 
    as in VR systems, you often have multiple windows open at a time (and thus multiple display contexts to render to).<BR>
    <BR><BR>
    For each display context you often need to create <a href="${GLOSSARY}#context data">context specific data</a>.
  </P>

<h3><a name="e">[E]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="environment_variable"><B>environment variable</B> - A variable
    that defines an aspect of your working environment such as your
    home directory, editor, or printer.  Such variables are set during
    the login/startup procedure.
  </P>

<h3><a name="f">[F]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="functor"><B>functor</B> - Something that performs an operation
    or a function.
  </P>

<h3><a name="g">[G]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="graphical_user_interface"><B>graphical user interface</B></A> -
    (GUI) The use of pictures rather than just words to represent the input
    and output of a program.  A program with a GUI runs under some windowing
    system (e.g., the X Window System, Microsoft Windows, Acorn RISC OS,
    NEXTSTEP).  The program displays certain icons, buttons, dialogue boxes,
    etc. in its windows on the screen.  The user controls it mainly by
    moving a pointer on the screen (typically controlled by a mouse) and
    selecting certain objects by pressing buttons on the mouse while the
    pointer is pointing at them.
  </P>

  <P>
    <A NAME="GUI"><B>GUI</B></A> - See
    <A HREF="#graphical_user_interface">graphical user interface</A>.

<h3><a name="m">[M]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="matrix"><B>matrix</B></A> - A rectangular array of numeric or
    algebraic quantities set out by rows and columns and subject to
    mathematical operations.
  </P>

  <P>
    <A NAME="mutex"><B>mutex</B></A> - A
    <A HREF="#mutual_exclusion">mutual exclusion</A> object that allows
    multiple <A HREF="#thread">threads</A> to synchronize access to shared
    resources.  A mutex has two states: locked and unlocked.  Once a mutex
    has been locked by a thread, other threads attempting to lock it will
    block.  When the locking thread unlocks (releases) the mutex, one of
    the blocked threads will lock (acquire) it and proceed with its
    execution.  A mutex is thus a binary <A HREF="#semaphore">semaphore</A>.
  </P>

  <P>
    <A NAME="mutual_exclusion"><B>mutual exclusion</B></A> - In computer
    science: a collection of techniques for sharing resources so that
    different manipulators of the resources do not conflict and cause
    unwanted interactions.
  </P>

<h3><a name="n">[N]</a></h3>

<h3><a name="o">[O]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="operating_system"><B>operating system</B> - (OS) The low-level
    software which handles the interface to peripheral hardware, schedules
    tasks, allocates storage, and presents a default interface to the user
    when no application program is running.
  </P>

<h3><a name="p">[P]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="platform"><B>platform</B></A> - Specific computer hardware, as
    in the phrase ``platform-independent''.  It may also refer to a specific
    combination of hardware and
    <A HREF="#operating_system">operating system</A> and/or
    <A HREF="#compiler">compiler</A>, as in ``this program has been ported
    to several platforms''.  It is also used to refer to support software
    for a particular activity, as in ``This program provides a platform for
    research into routing protocols''.  In the VR Juggler documentation, we
    refer to the platform as the combination of hardware and operating
    system.
  </P>

<p>
   <b><a name="proxy">proxy</a></b> - to act in place of another.  In VR Juggler a proxy is a handle or pointer to something else, typically an actual input device.  For example in an application a user would access an input device through a vjDeviceInterface - behind this proxy is a vjDeviceProxy - and behind <i>this</i> is a vjInput (the actual device).  The vjDeviceInterface is a <i>doubly</i> proxies the vjInput device since it is a proxy to the vjDeviceProxy.
</p>

<h3><a name="q">[Q]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="quaternion"><B>quaternion</B></A> - In mathematics: an
    expression that is the sum of a real number and a vector and that
    contains four terms, one real and three imaginary.  Also, the quotient
    of two vectors, or of two directed right lines in space, considered as
    depending on four geometrical elements, and as expressible by an
    algebraic symbol of quadrinomial form.  For more information, refer to

<h3><a name="s">[S]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="semaphore"><B>semaphore</B></A> - In computer science: a method
    for restricting access to shared resources in a multithreaded
    environment invented by Dijkstra.  Operations on semaphores can be either
    test or increment.  A semaphore is free if its value is greater than or
    equal to 1.  It is locked if its value is 0.
  </P>

  <P>
    <A NAME="smart_pointer"><B>smart pointer</B></A> - Objects that
    encapsulate C++ pointers.  They are a very powerful concept that can
    provide many features over standard pointers include safety in
    dereferencing.  A smart pointer is accessed using the dereference
    operator (<TT>-&gt;</TT>).
  </P>

   <P>
      <A NAME="surface window"><B>surface window</B></A> - A Juggler <b>Surface</b> Window 
      can be put into <tt>stereo</tt>, <tt>right eye</tt>, or 
      <tt>left eye</tt> display modes.  Most interesting is the stereo mode since it requires 
      special hardware to display stereo, and creates the most immersive experience.  
   </p>
   
   <p>
      <A NAME="simulator window"><B>simulator window</B></A> - A Juggler <b>Simulator</b> Window 
      is special because it simulates the VR system.  It can show
      the all active user's head and wand position and orientation as well as the display surfaces 
      themselves.  The simulator window is nice for debugging tracking systems, and to visually see
      the Display <b>Surface</b> configuration.
   </p>
<h3><a name="t">[T]</a></h3>

  <P>
    <A NAME="thread"><B>thread</B></A> - In computer science: a portion of
    a program that can run independently and concurrently with other
    portions of the same program.
  </P>

  <P>
    <A NAME="triple buffered data"><B>triple buffered data</B></A> - 
    It is sometimes wise to use triple buffered data, so that one thread is not 
    writing to the data as it is being read by a different thread.  
  </P>
  
  <P>
    <A NAME="tracker"><B>tracker</B></A> - 
    A tracker is a positional device used to tell where something is in space.
    <p>
    Some background: In a PC desktop environment the mouse is usually the only 
    tracking system available, with tracking done in 2 space (x,y coordinates)...
    This kind of device is usually not popularly desired by immersive VR enthusiests, 
    but is quite effective in entertainment applications such as Id Software's 
    Quake (the very popular keyboard/mouse combination is even sold as an add-on 
    to console systems such as SegaDreamcast and Playstation2)
    </p>
    <p>
    In VR a tracker gives you position information usually in 3 space 
    (x,y,z coordinates).  Generally the VR tracker is attached to 
    the body or held in the hand to let the computer know where you are 
    in space - allowing the VR system to "track" you.  
    Some popular VR tracking devices are the Wand, or Glove - which uses both
    digital (button) input and positional (tracking) input.
    </p>
    Almost always tracking input is used in conjunction with button input, 
    as seen in many devices such as Wand, Glove, and even the Mouse
  </P>
<h3><a name="u">[U]</a></h3>

<h3><a name="v">[V]</a></h3>

<P>
  <A NAME="vector"><B>vector</B></A> - In mathematics: a quantity, such as
  a velocity, completely specified by a magnitude and a direction; a
  one-dimensional array; an element of a vector space.
</P>
