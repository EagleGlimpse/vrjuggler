<h2><img border=0 src="${IMAGES}/Icons/24x24_Images/Battery.gif"> Juggler Virtual Reality Platform - Mission Statement</h2>

<p>
    VR technology as a whole is stagnating with its closed source solutions.  
    This means that anyone new to VR need to completely develop a new solution, 
    often inferior than others.  Releasing an open VR system is vital to 
    the development of VR.  Instead of reinplementing VR systems, people
    need to focus on implementing new VR ideas and methods so that VR technology 
    can mature to make us all a ton of money. :)
</p>
<p>
    Now because of VR Juggler, people can focus on implementing 
    these new VR ideas and methods for the future because now this 
    standard technology is readily available to all, free from cost 
    or legal ties.

<h3>Below is an image of what VR Juggler should be and do to accomplish the above goal.</h3>

<!-- TODO: refactor this text into more of a specification, rather than "what it already does"... -->

<p>
Juggler is a platform for virtual reality applications. The name comes from the delicate balance that must be
struck between flexibility, performance, and ease-of-use.  You develop your
application once for Juggler, then anywhere that Juggler is supported, your application
is also supported.  </p>

<p>VR juggler's design addresses several key requirements for a virtual reality
development system. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance</li>
  <li>Flexibility</li>
  <li>Rapid application development</li>
  <li>Ease of use</li>
  <li>Extensibility</li>
  <li>Portability</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

Flexibility is achieved by placing common abstractions over I/O
devices.  New devices can  be added easily, and existing devices
can be reconfigured or replaced, even while an application is running.<br><br>

To allow optimal performance, applications are given direct access to
graphics APIs (currently including OpenGL&#153 and Iris Performer&#153).<BR><BR>

VR Juggler includes built-in support for performance
monitoring of applications and graphics subsystems.  It
supports multiple-processor machines and will support distributing 
applications across multiple machines.<br><br>

Using VR Juggler and developing applications are kept as simple as
possible.  Small base classes provide a skeleton for application
development, while the abstractions of I/O devices simplify programming.
During run-time, any VR Juggler application can be controlled or 
reconfigured by a Java-based graphical interface.<br><br>

VR Juggler is designed to support a wide array of VR hardware on a 
variety of architectures.  Several tracking systems, gloves, and
input devices are already supported.  Juggler supports projection-
based displays such as the CAVE&#153 or C2, and includes support for 
head-mounted devices.  Development work is being done on <b>IRIX</b>, <b>LiNUX</b>, <b>Windows NT</b>, <b>Solaris</b>&#153, and <b>FreeBSD</b>
systems, with reports of success on <b>HP/UX</b>&#153.<br><br>
