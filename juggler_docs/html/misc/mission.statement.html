<h2><img border=0 src="${IMAGES}/Icons/24x24_Images/Battery.gif"> Juggler Virtual Reality Platform - Mission Statement</h2>

<p>Juggler is a platform for virtual reality applications. You develop your
application once for Juggler, then anywhere that Juggler is supported, your application
is also supported.</p>

<p>VR juggler's design addresses several key requirements for a virtual reality
development system. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance</li>
  <li>Flexibility</li>
  <li>Rapid application development</li>
  <li>Ease of use</li>
  <li>Extensibility</li>
  <li>Portability</li>
</ul>

VR Juggler is a C++ based development system for Virtual Reality
applications.  The name comes from the delicate balance that must be
struck between flexibility, performance, and ease-of-use.<br><br>

Flexibility is achieved by placing common abstractions over I/O
devices.  New devices can  be added easily, and existing devices
can be reconfigured or replaced, even while and application is running.<br><br>

To allow optimal performance, applications are given direct access to
graphics APIs (currently including OpenGL&#153 and Iris Performer&#153).<BR><BR>

VR Juggler will also include built-in support for performance
monitoring of applications, processors, and graphics subsystems.  It
supports multiple-processor machines and will support distributing 
applications accross multiple machines.<br><br>

Using VR Juggler and developing applications are kept as simple as
possible.  Small base classes provide a skeleton for application
development, while the abstractions of I/O devices simplify programming.
During run-time, any VR Juggler application can be controlled or 
reconfigured by a Java-based graphical interface.<br><br>

VR Juggler is designed to support a wide array of VR hardware on a 
variety of achitectures.  Several tracking systems, gloves, and
input devices are already supported.  Juggler supports projection-
based displays such as the CAVE&#153 or C2, and will include support for 
head-mounted devices.  Intial development work is being done on SGI
systems, with planned ports to HP/UX&#153 and Windows NT&#153.<br><br>
