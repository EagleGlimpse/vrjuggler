<A NAME="intro"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>

  <P>
    As with most OpenSource projects, VR Juggler is distributed as
    compressed archive files using popular formats.  Installing a
    distribution requires very little effort, but you do need to know
    how to use archiving utilities to extract the installation tree.
    Automation of the installation is a goal of the VR Juggler team, but
    we are not there yet.  Before reading further, you should know where
    you want to install VR Juggler, and you should make sure that you
    have access to write to that directory.
  </P>

<A NAME="tar"><H2>Installing from a Compressed TAR File</H2></A>

  <P>
    The TAR (Tape ARchive) format has been around for a long, long time
    in the UNIX world.  It is simply a collection of files in a directory
    tree that are lumped into a single file suitable for writing to a tape
    or for downloading.  The format is a standard, and the <TT>tar</TT>(1)
    utility is available on every UNIX-based platform and on Win32.  A
    free version can be downloaded from
    <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/" TARGET="_top">the GNU Project</A>.  A
    compressed TAR file is made for each VR Juggler distribution, and some
    distributions come in other formats as well.  You can always count on
    the availability of a TAR file, though.  The TAR files are compressed
    using GZIP which is a standard compression format.  The <TT>gzip</TT>(1)
    utility is freely available from
    <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/" TARGET="_top">the GNU Project</A> (the
    GNU version of TAR has the GZIP algorithm built in) if your platform
    does not have it.
  </P>

  <P>
    Once you have downloaded a VR Juggler TAR distribution, you can unpack
    it one of two ways depending on what your platform's version of TAR
    supports.  Before extracting the installation tree, make sure that your
    current directory is the one where you want to install VR Juggler.  If
    your version of TAR does not have GZIP built in (it does not support the
    <TT>-z</TT> option), the following command will do the decompression and
    extraction:

<PRE>
    % <B>gzip -cd &lt;vrjuggler-distribution.tar.gz&gt; | tar -xvf -</B>
</PRE>

    Here, you should fill in the
    <TT>&lt;vrjuggler-distribution.tar.gz&gt;</TT> with the name of the
    VR Juggler distribution file you downloaded.  The above command will
    work with any shell that supports redirection of standard output to a
    pipe.  If that looks too scary, you can separate the decompression and
    extraction into two commands:

<PRE>
    % <B>gunzip &lt;vrjuggler-distribution.tar.gz&gt;</B>
    % <B>tar -xvf &lt;vrjuggler-distribution.tar&gt;</B>
</PRE>

    Note that the distribution file in the second command does not have the
    <TT>.gz</TT> extension after <TT>gzip</TT>(1) is run.  These steps also
    work if your version of <TT>tar</TT>(1) supports the <TT>-z</TT> option,
    but you can simplify your work if that option is supported.  The
    follow illustrates how to uncompress and extract all in one step:

<PRE>
    % <B>tar -xzvf &lt;vrjuggler-distribution.tar.gz&gt;</B>
</PRE>

    Note that <TT>z</TT> is included among the command-line arguments
    given to <TT>tar</TT>(1).  This tells it to uncompress the archive
    first.
  </P>

  <P>
    In either case, while the command runs, you will see the name of each
    file as it is written to disk.  This is because of the <TT>v</TT> option
    to <TT>tar</TT>(1) that tells it to be verbose in its efforts.
    <TT>tar</TT>(1) takes care of creating all the directories in the
    installation tree, so you only need to have the base directory (for
    example, <TT>/usr/local</TT>) when you start.  For more information
    about these utilities, please refer to the <TT>tar</TT>(1) and
    <TT>gzip</TT>(1) manual pages.
  </P>

<A NAME="zip"><H2>Installing from a ZIP File (Win32 only)</H2></A>

  <P>
    On the Win32 family of platforms, the ZIP format rules.  In the old
    days, you would use the PKZIP utility to uncompress and extract a
    ZIP file.  Nowadays, you use <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</A>
    or some other comparable graphical interface.  This documentation
    covers only the use of WinZip when extracting a ZIP file.
  </P>

  <P>
    Once you have downloaded the VR Juggler ZIP file, the easiest way to
    extract it is to double-click on its icon in the open folder window
    as shown below:
  </P>

  <P>
    Double-clicking opens the main WinZip window:
  </P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <IMG SRC="${GETTINGSTARTED}/Window.WinZip.jpg" ALT="">
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>
    Note that in this screenshot, the ``Extract'' button is highlighted.
    Click this button to open the following window:
  </P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <IMG SRC="${GETTINGSTARTED}/Window.WinZip.Extract.jpg" ALT="">
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>
    In this window, choose the directory where VR Juggler will be
    installed and click ``Extract''.  WinZip will then proceed to extract
    the ZIP file into the directory you named.  That's all there is to it.
  </P>
