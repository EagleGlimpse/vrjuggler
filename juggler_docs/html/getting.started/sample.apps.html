<A NAME="intro"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>

  <P>
    VR Juggler comes with several sample applications in its <TT>samples</TT>
    directory tree.  Many of them are very simple and are designed to
    demonstrate a specific feature of VR Juggler or a technique to use when
    writing your own applications.  This chapter lists the current sample
    applications as of this writing and gives a quick description of what
    you as a potential developer might find interesting in the code.  Those
    users who just want to run applications can safely skip this chapter.

<A NAME="opengl"><H2>OpenGL Applications</H2></A>

  <P>
    The OpenGL sample applications are in <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/samples/ogl</TT>.
    They are as follows:

    <UL>
      <LI>
	Analog: A very simple demo that allows you to test out analog 
           capabilities in VR Juggler.  Use an analog simulator, or 
           a real analog device (like a potentiometer, etc), you can move 
           a cube from the floor to 6 feet above the floor.  <BR><BR>

        <b>NOTE:</b> This demo is commented well, so would also be a good 
           application for you to learn VRJuggler from (very basic though).
      </LI>
      <LI>
	Cones: A 10x10x10 array of cones in space.  The cones are created
	using GLU quadrics.  Navigation is done using
	<A HREF="${GLOSSARY}#quaternion">quaternions</A> and is not
	recommended as a basis for navigation in most applications.
      </LI>
      <LI>
	Cubes: A 10x10x10 array of cubes in space.  The cubes are created
	using OpenGL display lists.  This is the best example of using
	display in VR Juggler and should be studied carefully.  Navigation
	is done using quaternions and is not recommended as a basis for
	navigation in most applications.
      </LI>
      <LI>
	Torus: A very, very simple that renders a purple torus at a key
	point in space.  That is, the torus is positioned such that in a
	CAVE-like device, the center of the torus is at the lower left
	corner of the device where the front wall, left wall and floor
	meet.  It is designed specifically to test VR Juggler's handling
	of multiple walls and project alignment (in an <I>extremely</I>
	crude manner).  Lighting of the torus is done with a flashlight on
	the wand but should not be used as an example of doing lighting in
	VR Juggler.  The behavior of the flashlight is very hard to predict.
      </LI>
      <LI>
	Wand: A trivial program showing how to get input from a wand
	using digital inputs (buttons).  This application is designed
	primarily as a tool to test wand tracking and button input in a
	VR system.
      </LI>
      <LI>
	Texture: An application demonstrating the use of OpenGL texture
	objects (and display lists).  It includes code for loading many 
        different texture formats (SGI(RGB and RGBA) / BMP / TGA(24 and 32 bit) / PCX).<BR><BR>

        <b>NOTE:</b> This demo is commented well, so would also be a good application for you
           to learn VRJuggler from.
      </LI>
      <LI>
	Combo: A collection of Cubes, Torus and Wand that demonstrates how
	to cycle between three VR Juggler OpenGL applications.
      </LI>
      <LI>
	Glove:
      </LI>
      <LI>
	SimpleGlove: A very simple application that shows how to use the
	VR Juggler glove interface with a gesture interface.
      </LI>
      <LI>
	DigitalGlove: Based on SimpleGlove, this ia another simple
	application that shows how to use the VR Juggler glove interface
	but this time with digital interfaces for each finger.
      </LI>
    </UL>
  </P>

<A NAME="performer"><H2>IRIS Performer Applications</H2></A>

  <P>
    Examples of IRIS Performer applications can be found in
    <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/samples/pf</TT>.  These are for more advanced
    developers who are familiar with Performer and some of the more
    complicated aspects of VR Juggler.  There are two main programs
    there:

    <UL>
      <LI>
	pfNav: A starting point for basic VR Juggler Performer applications
	that need to load a model and navigate through it.  Users implement
	their application by inheriting from a provided class
	<TT>simplePfNav</TT>.  This is a good place for Performer
	beginners to start because <TT>simplePfNav</TT> hides many of the
	complicated details (which actually makes that class far from
	simple).
      </LI>
      <LI>
	pfConfigNav: A more advanced example of a VR Juggler Performer
	application that can be given its model through a VR Juggler
	config chunk.
      </LI>
    </UL>
