<A NAME="intro"><H3>Introduction</H3></A>

  <P>
    Now that you have VR Juggler installed and you have your environment all
    configured, it's time for the fun to begin.  No, seriously.  You are now
    ready to compile and run VR Juggler applications, and that's the whole
    point, right?  This document explains how to compile the applications
    provided in the directory <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/samples</TT>.
  </P>

<A NAME="reading"><H3>Required Reading</H3></A>

  <P>
    Before reading any further, make sure you have already read the
    instructions on how to <A HREF="${GETTINGSTARTED}/install.html">install
    VR Juggler</A> and on how to
    <A HREF="${GETTINGSTARTED}/environment.variables.html">configure your
    environment</A>.  That information will not be repeated, and it is
    assumed that you already know what we mean by <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR</TT>.
    You should also have a basic understanding of how <TT>make</TT>(1)
    works, but in these examples, nothing more will be necessary than
    typing <TT>make</TT> on the command line.  Refer to the
    <TT>make</TT>(1) manual page for more information about it.
  </P>

<A NAME="compiling"><H3>Compiling an Application</H3></A>

  <P>
    All the sample programs in <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/samples</TT> use the same
    basic steps to compile unless otherwise noted.  Always refer to the
    top of the sample application's <TT>Makefile</TT> for information that
    may be specific to building that application.  In general, though, all
    applications' makefiles are compatible with the standard version of
    the <TT>make</TT>(1) utility.  This includes the <TT>nmake</TT>
    command provided with Visual C++.
  </P>

  <P>
    The example used here will be the <TT>torus</TT> application found in
    <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/samples/ogl/torus</TT>.  It is an OpenGL-based
    application that will compile and run on all platforms supported by
    VR Juggler.  Begin by changing into the directory
    <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/samples/ogl/torus</TT> in a command shell.
  </P>

  <P>
    To compile <TT>torus</TT>, simply enter the following:

<PRE>
    % <B>make</B>
</PRE>

    or on Win32 without Cygwin, enter:

<PRE>
    % <B>nmake</B>
</PRE>

    The compile process will then begin.  If you have your system set up
    properly, it will complete with an executable <TT>torus</TT> file (or
    <TT>torus.exe</TT> on Win32) in the directory.  Now that you have a
    program compiled, it's time to
    <A HREF="${GETTINGSTARTED}/app.running.html">learn how to run it</A>.
  </P>

<A NAME="extra"><H3>Additional Notes</H3></A>

  <P>
    In some cases, VR Juggler applications have makefiles that require
    the use of GNU make.  This is always noted in the heading comments of
    <TT>Makefile</TT> in the application's directory.  GNU make is free
    software that can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">the
    GNU Project</A>.  Some operating system vendors provide pre-compiled
    packages for easy installation of GNU software.
  </P>

  <P>
    On the Win32 family of platforms, it is possible to develop VR Juggler
    applications as Visual C++ projects rather than using the
    command-line interface.  We do not currently have an example of how to
    do this, but when it is available, it will be in the
    <A HREF="${PROGRAMMERGUIDE}">Programmer Guide</A>.
  </P>
