<A NAME="intro"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>

  <P>
    There are several
    <A HREF="${GLOSSARY}#environment_variable">environment variables</A>
    that affect the way that VR Juggler works.  Some of these are required
    to compile and run applications while others are optional.  This page
    lists all such variables and explains their meanings and uses.
  </P>

<A NAME="setting"><H2>How to Set Environment Variables</H2></A>

  <P>
    The syntax for setting or changing an environment variable varies with 
    operating systems and shell interpreters.  Instead of choosing one
    style of syntax that is specific to a particular shell type, we define
    our own syntax which you must then translate to your shell's specific
    syntax.  Before defining this syntax, we present the method used to set
    environment variables in the three most common types of shells.  We
    also provide a quick overview of how to set environment variables
    using Win32-based GUIs.
  </P>

<A NAME="common"><H3>Common Conventions and Background</H3></A>

  <P>
    A convention used throughout is to name the variables using all capital
    letters.  In almost all cases regardless of the shell, this is the
    naming convention used for environment variables.
  </P>

  <P>
    Setting a path with an environment variable can require special syntax.
    Because of this, the method for doing so may vary from shell to shell.
    Paths are important with VR Juggler when looking up the path to a
    shared library (dynamically linked library).  For each shell, the
    syntax for setting a path is given.
  </P>

  <P>
    Referring to environment variables can also vary from shell to shell.
    An example of how to print the value of an environment variable is
    given for each shell.  An example of how to refer to an environment
    variable is also provided as these two operations may vary even within
    one kind of shell!
  </P>

  <P>
    In all shells, an environment variable is only available within that
    single shell instance.  That is, setting an environment variable at
    a command prompt only affects that specific shell and will not be
    available from other concurrent or future shells.  To make a setting
    ``permanent'', it should be done in file read by all shell instances
    when they are started.  This is addressed briefly as appropriate for
    each shell type.
  </P>

<A NAME="csh"><H3>C-Style Shells (csh, tcsh)</H3></A>

  <P>
    In a C-style shell (i.e., one whose interface is based on the C
    programming language), setting environment variables is done using
    the built-in command <TT>setenv</TT>.  It is used as follows:

<PRE>
    % <B>setenv &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt; &lt;value&gt;</B>
</PRE>

    where the string <TT>&lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</TT> represents the name of
    the variable you are going to set and <TT>&lt;value&gt;</TT>
    represents the value assigned to that variable.  Both are required.
    If the named variable did not exist before, it will pop into
    existence.  Otherwise, you overwrite the old setting with the new one.
  </P>

  <P>
    To print the value of an environment variable, use the following
    command:

<PRE>
    % <B>printenv &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</B>
</PRE>

    Referring to a variable, however, is done using the following
    syntax:

<PRE>
    % <B>cd $VARIABLE_NAME/bin</B>
</PRE>
  </P>

  <P>
    Paths are specified as a colon-separated list.  An example of this is:

<PRE>
    % <B>printenv PATH</B>
    /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
</PRE>
  </P>

  <P>
    For these types of shells, a ``permanent'' setting for a given
    variable should usually be done in your <TT>.cshrc</TT> file or in your
    <TT>.login</TT> file, both of which should be in your home directory.
    In most cases, it is better to use <TT>.cshrc</TT> because it is
    evaluated for every shell instance.
  </P>

<A NAME="sh"><H3><TT>sh</TT>-Derived Shells (sh, ksh, bash, zsh, etc.)</H3></A>

  <P>
    In a shell based on <TT>sh</TT>, setting environment variables is done
    using the built-in command <TT>export</TT>.  It is used as follows:

<PRE>
    % <B>export &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</B>
</PRE>

    or

<PRE>
    % <B>&lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</B>
    % <B>export &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</B>
</PRE>

    Here, the string <TT>&lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</TT> represents the name of
    the variable you are going to set and <TT>&lt;value&gt;</TT>
    represents the value assigned to that variable.  Both are required.
    Note that there is <I>no space</I> between the variable name and its
    value.  If the named variable did not exist before, it will pop into
    existence.  Otherwise, you overwrite the old setting with the new one.
    If the variable was already among your current shell's environment
    variables, the <TT>export</TT> command is not necessary.
  </P>

  <P>
    To print the value of an environment variable, use the following
    command:

<PRE>
    % <B>echo $VARIABLE_NAME</B>
</PRE>

    Getting the value of a variable works the same way.
  </P>

  <P>
    Paths are specified as a colon-separated list.  An example of this is:

<PRE>
    % <B>echo $PATH</B>
    /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
</PRE>
  </P>

  <P>
    For these types of shells, a ``permanent'' setting for a given
    variable should usually be done in the <TT>.profile</TT> file in your
    home directory or in your shell's ``rc'' file.  Different shells have
    different names for this file.  Examples are <TT>.bashrc</TT> for
    BASH and <TT>.zshrc</TT> for zsh.  Please refer to your shell's
    documentation for more information.  In any case, the file will be in
    your home directory.
  </P>

<A NAME="dosshell"><H3>DOS Shell</H3></A>

  <P>
    The typical syntax for setting an environment variable from the command
    line (in a DOS shell window) under Win32 is:

<PRE>
    C:\&gt; <B>set &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</B>
</PRE>

    Here, <TT>&lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</TT> is the name of the environment
    variable to be set, and <TT>&lt;value&gt;</TT> is the value being
    assigned to that variable.  If the named variable did not exist before,
    it will pop into existence.  Otherwise, you overwrite the old setting
    with the new one.
  </P>

  <P>
    To print the value of an environment variable, use the following
    command:

<PRE>
    C:\&gt; <B>set &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</B>
</PRE>

    Referring to a variable, however, is done using the following
    syntax:

<PRE>
    C:\&gt; <B>cd %VARIABLE_NAME%\bin</B>
</PRE>
  </P>

  <P>
    Paths are specified as a semicolon-separated list.  An example of this
    is:

<PRE>
    C:\&gt; <B>set PATH</B>
    C:\WINDOWS;C:\bin;C:\
</PRE>
  </P>

  <P>
    For some versions of Windows, a ``permanent'' setting for a given
    variable should usually be done in <TT>C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT</TT>.  In
    newer versions and in the Windows NT line, the setting is done using
    the Control Panel.  Please refer to the <A HREF="#gui">next section</A>
    for more information on that method.
  </P>

<A NAME="gui"><H3>Win32 GUI</H3></A>

  <P>
    Before reading this section, please be sure to have read the section
    on <A HREF="#dosshell">using a DOS shell</A>.  This is necessary
    because the Win32 GUI for setting environment variables is simply a
    frontend to that older method and thus uses the same conventions and
    syntax.  The versions of Windows to which this subsection applies
    are indicated individually since each is a little different.  For
    more detailed information, please refer to the Windows online help
    system and search for ``environment variables''.
  </P>

  <DL>
    <DT><B>Windows 2000</B>
      <DD>
	In the Control Panel, open the ``System'' icon.  Under the
	``Advanced'' tab, there is a button labeled ``Environment
	Variables''.  Here, you can set variables for yourself and, if you
	have the access privileges, for all users.
      </DD>
    <DT><B>Windows NT 4.0</B>
      <DD>
	In the Control Panel, open the ``System'' icon.  The window that
	is opened has a tab labeled ``Environment Variables''.  Here, you
	can set variables for yourself and, if you have the access
	privileges, for all users.

  </DL>

<A NAME="syntax"><H2>Syntax Used in this Document</H2></A>

  <P>
    To avoid tying this documentation to a single style of environment
    variable creation, assignment and reference, the following syntax
    will be used exclusively from this point onward.  Please read this
    carefully before proceeding.
  </P>

  <DL>
    <DT><B>Naming environment variables</B>
      <DD>
	When naming an environment variable in the plain text of this
	document, the variable will be referred to by its name only.
	For example, to talk about the environment variable containing
	your path, we will talk about it as <TT>PATH</TT>.
      </DD>
    <DT><B>Creating/setting environment variables</B>
      <DD>
	The syntax to set an environment variable is:

<PRE>
    % <B>&lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt; = &lt;value&gt;</B>
</PRE>

	Setting an environment variable also creates it if it is not already
	present in the current shell's environment.
      </DD>
    <DT><B>Printing an environment variable's value</B>
      <DD>
	Printing an environment variable's value to standard output (stdout)
	is done as follows:

<PRE>
    % <B>echo $VARIABLE_NAME</B>
    value
</PRE>
      </DD>
    <DT><B>Referring to an environment variable's value</B>
      <DD>
	To get the value of an environment variable when it needs to be
	expanded, the following syntax will be used:

<PRE>
    % <B>cd $VARIABLE_NAME/bin</B>
</PRE>

	Here, the reference to the value is <TT>$VARIABLE_NAME</TT>.
      </DD>
  </DL>

<A NAME="required"><H2>Required Environment Variables</H2></A>

  <DL>
    <DT><B><TT>VJ_BASE_DIR</TT></B>
      <DD>
	The environment variable <TT>VJ_BASE_DIR</TT> tells a VR Juggler
	application where to find important data files.  It is required to
	compile and run any Juggler app.  It should be set to the base
	directory of the installed VR Juggler library.  For example, if you
	downloaded a UNIX version of VR Juggler 0.1.97 and extracted it to the
	directory <TT>/home/software/</TT>, you would set <TT>VJ_BASE_DIR</TT>
	with this command:

<PRE>
    % <B>VJ_BASE_DIR = /home/software/<I>vrjuggler-0.1.97</I></B>
</PRE>

	The last component of this example (the part in italics) depends on
	the particular version of Juggler you have downloaded.

	<P>

	If you downloaded and built VR Juggler from the source code, the 
	compilation creates a directory called <TT>instlinks</TT> which can
	be used as a Juggler base:

<PRE>
    % <B>VJ_BASE_DIR = $HOME/juggler/my_build_dir/instlinks</B>
</PRE>

	In any case, on a Win32 platform, you should use <TT>/</TT>'s as the
	path separator for VJ_BASE_DIR rather than <TT>\</TT>'s.  The compiler
	tools can handle either, and the utilities in <TT>juggler-tools</TT>
	will behave much better if UNIX-style paths are used.  It is safe to
	use the drive letter at the start of the path (e.g.,
	``<TT>C:/software/vrjuggler-0.1.97</TT>'').
      </DD>
    <DT><B><TT>JDK_HOME</TT></B>
      <DD>
	The <TT>JDK_HOME</TT> environment variable is required by the script
	that starts VjControl, the VR Juggler configuration program.  If
	Java is installed on your system, <TT>JDK_HOME</TT> may already be
	set.  If not, it needs to be set to the base of the Java
	installation.
      </DD>
    <DT><B><TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH (UNIX/Linux only)<BR>
	LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH (IRIX only)<BR>
	LD_LIBRARY64_PATH (IRIX only)</TT></B>
      <DD>
	UNIX/Linux systems use these environment variables to find
	dynamically loaded libraries, such as <TT>libJuggler.so</TT>.
	Unless you're building everything with static libraries, you will
	need to set these to include the Juggler library directory (under
	<TT>VJ_BASE_DIR</TT>).  IRIX supports several Application Binary
	Interfaces (ABIs).  VR Juggler supports only the N32 and 64
	formats, and there are different library path variables for each.
	The N32 ABI uses the <TT>LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH</TT> variable, and
	the 64 ABI uses <TT>LD_LIBRARY64_PATH</TT>.  An example of
	setting the library path is as follows:

<PRE>
    % <B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib</B>
</PRE>

	<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> If the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is already defined,
	you do not want to destroy the current value, just append the new
	path to it.  Otherwise something else could stop working.  In this
	case, you want to set the variable(s) in the following manner:

<PRE>
    % <B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$VJ_BASE_DIR/lib</B>
</PRE>

	<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> On some SGI systems running IRIX, users of the
	MIPSpro compiler (version 7.3) will need to add another directory
	as follows:

<PRE>
    % <B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib32/cmplrs:$VJ_BASE_DIR</B>
</PRE>

	This is needed so that the compiler can find shared libraries it
	needs when linking applications.
      </DD>
  </DL>

<A NAME="optional"><H2>Optional Related Environment Variables</H2></A>

  <DL>
    <DT><B><TT>PATH</TT></B>
      <DD>
	If you intend to use the VjControl program, you may want to add the 
	$VJ_BASE_DIR/bin directory to your $PATH as follows:

<PRE>
    % <B>PATH = $PATH:$VJ_BASE_DIR/bin</B>
</PRE>
      </DD>
    <DT><B><TT>VJ_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL</TT></B>
      <DD>
	This variable can be used to control the amount of diagnostic
	information a VR Juggler application outputs.  Its value is a
	number between 0 (only very important messages are printed) and 7
	(vast amounts of data) inclusive.  Non-hackers are advised to use
	levels 0 through 3, as higher debug levels become increasingly
	cryptic and can <I>severely impact application performance</I>.
	<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">The default is level 1</FONT>--only errors
	and critical information is output.  An example of setting a
	value for this variable is:

<PRE>
    % <B>VJ_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL = 3</B>
</PRE>
      </DD>
    <DT><B><TT>VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES</TT></B>
      <DD>
	This variable can be used to control which components of VR Juggler
	are allowed to output diagnostic data.  If for some reason you set
	<TT>VJ_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL</TT> to 5 or higher, this variable can be
	used to filter the output.  The value of <TT>VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES</TT>
	is a space-separated list of Juggler debug component names (defined
	in <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/include/Kernel/vjDebug.h</TT>).  The default
	value is ``<TT>DBG_ALL</TT>'', which performs no filtering
	whatsoever.  Examples of setting it are as follows:

<PRE>
    % <B>VJ_DEBUG_CATAGORIES = DBG_ERROR</B>
    % <B>VJ_DEBUG_CATAGORIES = "DBG_KERENEL DBG_INPUT"</B>
    % <B>VJ_DEBUG_CATAGORIES = "DBG_CONFIGDB DBG_ENV_MGR"</B>
</PRE>
      </DD>
  </DL>
