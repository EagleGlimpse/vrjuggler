loading files & about java1.1

<h3>Loading Files</h3>

VR Juggler uses two types of files: <i>Config Files</i> and <i>ChunkDesc Files</i>.

<ul>
<li><i>Config Files</i> are made of 'Chunks' of information.  For example,
one chunk will describe the setup of a display device while another will
describe the setup for a keyboard or tracking system.  There will typically
be several readymade config files in the <tt>$VJ_BASE_DIR/Data</tt> directory,
with names like <tt>simulator.config</tt> or <tt>C2_4wall.config</tt>.

<li><i>ChunkDesc Files</i> define the different kinds of chunks (ie. what kind
of information a Keyboard chunk should have, or a Display chunk).  The main
ChunkDesc file for VR Juggler is usually <tt>$VJ_BASE_DIR/Data/chunksDesc</tt>.
</ul>

To load a Config or ChunkDesc file, click on the "Configure" or "Descriptions"
tabs of the VjControl GUI, and then press the "Load" button.

<h3>Using VjControl with java 1.1</h3>
Version 1.2 of Sun's JDK has been available for several months, but some
platforms are still laggin on porting and deploying it.  It is possible
to run VjControl on a system with the older JDK 1.1 installed, with a little
bit of work.

<p>First, you need to download and install the Java Foundation Classes (Swing 
classes) for JDK 1.1.  Pay particular attention to the location of the
file <TT>swingall.jar</TT>.

<p>The $VJ_BASE_DIR/bin directory contains script called vjcontrol1.1
which will start up vjcontrol on systems with JDK1.1 and Swing.  You may
need to edit the script file to make sure the paths used for classes.zip
and <TT>swingall.jar</TT> are correct.  In particular, the script expects 
a copy of the <TT>swingall.jar</TT> file to be copied or linked in the 
<TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/bin</TT> directory.
