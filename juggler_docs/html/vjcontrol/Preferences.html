VjControl Preferences</H2>

Vjcontrol has a number of user-configurable options.  On startup,
it will attempt to load these preferences from the file
<tt>~/.vjconfig/vjcontrol.cfg</tt>.  If that file does not exist,
vjcontrol falls back to its hardcoded defaults.

<p>
The preferences can be
accessed from "Preferences" in the Options menu.  "Edit Preferences"
brings up a window to (surprise) edit the preferences.  This is the
same as the usual window used for editing ConfigChunks.

<p>
The "Save Preferences" option saves the current preferences to
 <tt>~/.vjconfig/vjcontrol.cfg</tt>, where they will be loaded
from the next time vjcontrol starts. 

<p>
<h3>VjControl Preference Options:</h3>

<ul>
<li><h4>Look and Feel</h4> - this can be used to change the overall
look and feel (L&F) of the GUI, using the Java Swing classes.  The 
possible options are: Java (the default, also called "Metal"), Motif, Windows, and Macintosh.
Note that the Windows and Mac L&Fs are only available when 
running on their respective platforms.  Vjcontrol will revert to Java/Metal
if the requested L&F is unavailable.
<p>
Most of the differences between L&Fs are cosmetic, but you
may wish to experiment.  The Windows L&F performs slightly better than
Java/Metal under W98/NT.  The Java/Metal L&F has been most extensively tested.
<p>

<li><h4>Default Host and Default Port</h4> - These are the default host name
and port number that will appear in the Connections panel.  See
<a href="DynamicReconfiguration.html">Dynamic Reconfiguration</a> for more information.
<p>

<li><h4>Preload ChunkDesc Files</h4> - Here you can specify one or more
Chunk Description files that will be loaded automatically when vjcontrol
starts up.  The arguments are simply pathnames to files.  If the strings
"$VJ_BASE_DIR" or "$HOME" are included in a path name, they will be replaced
with the value of the $VJ_BASE_DIR environment variable or the user's
home directory, respectively.
<p>
It is suggested that you include <tt>VJ_BASE_DIR/Data/chunksDesc</tt>, the
main Chunk Description file.
<p>
You can override the automatic loading of files at startup by using the 
-noautoload <a href="cmdline.html">command-line argument</a>.
<p>

<li><h4>Preload Configuration Files</h4> - This lets you specify one or more
Configuration files to load at startup (The details are similar to the
option above).
<p>

<li><h4>Default ConfigChunk Files</h4> - This lets you specify one or more
Configuration files which contain default values for new ConfigChunks.
When you create a new ConfigChunk in VjControl, it checks the default files 
for a Chunk of that type.  If found, it copies that value into the new Chunk.
<p>

<li><h4>Font Name and Font Size</h4> - This specifies the name and size of
font to use for all of vjcontrol's windows.  Note that currently only a 
small number of fonts are available (this is a limitation of JDK 1.1,
and will be fixed at a later date).
