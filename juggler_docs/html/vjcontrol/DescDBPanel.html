Vjcontrol includes the ability to view and edit the Chunk Description
files, allowing you to create new kinds of ConfigChunks or modify existing
Chunks.  Typically, there are two reasons you might want to do this:
<ol>
<li>You're an application writer, and you want your application to be
able to configure itself using the VR Juggler configuration mechanism.
You could create a new kind of ConfigChunk that contains information
specific to your application.
<li>You're developing a new component for VR Juggler - a device driver,
or something similar.  Right now this is only possible for developers
with access to the Juggler source.
</ol>

<p>
You can load and edit VR Juggler Chunk Description Files by clicking on the 
"Descriptions" tab of vjcontrol's main window.

<p>The Descriptions panel is similar to the <a href="ChunkDBPanel.html">
Configure panel</a>, without the side-by-side display of multiple files.

<p>
The ComboBox at the top of the panel lets you choose which of the
loaded description files to display (in this case, the file is called
``chunksDesc'').  Below that is a list of all the ChunkDescs defined
in the file.  Click on a name 
to select it.  You can double-click
on a name to view or edit the ChunkDesc.

<p>
There are six buttons along the side of the panel:

<ul>
<li>New - creates a new (empty) descriptions file.
<li>Load - loads a descriptions file.
<li>Save - save the descriptions file currently being viewed.  Note that this
button always opens a file dialog, so it's technically ``Save As...''
<li>Close - removes the currently viewed description file from memory.
<b>WARNING!</b> VjControl does not currently warn you if you close a
file without saving it.

<li>Remove - deletes all selected descriptions in the currently viewed file.
<li>Insert - inserts a new description.  Initially, a new description only
has one property - the instance name.

</ul>

<h3>The ChunkDesc Editing Window</h3>

Double-clicking on the name of a ChunkDesc brings up a new window, like
this:
