To determine what version of Java is installed on your system, use the
command:

<pre>
        java -version
</pre>

Note that this assumes the java command is in your search path.  If not,
you will have to ask or find where it is installed in your system.  
Typical locations include <tt>/usr/local/java/bin/java</tt>,
<tt>/usr/java/bin/java</tt>, and <tt>/usr/bin/java</tt>.

<p>
Typically, the result printed out by the java executable will be something
like this:

<pre>
java version "1.1.7B"
</pre>

The example above is from the Blackdown Linux port of JDK 1.1 (maintenance 
release 7).  As noted on the <a href="GettingStarted.html">Getting Started
</a> page, this system would be able to run vjcontrol with a little bit
of <a href="GettingStarted.html#jdk11">extra work</a>.

<p>
Unfortunately, some systems confuse the matter by having separate version
numbers for the implementation itself and for the jdk version they
implement.  For example, the following is taken from two different
versions of SGI's JDK:

<pre>
.. add text ..
</pre>

We're only concerned about the JDK version.  The first is using 1.2 (what
we want) and the second is 1.1 (which we can <a href="GettingStarted.html#jdk11"> put up with</a>).
