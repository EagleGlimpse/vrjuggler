<h1>Converting from CAVElib(TM) to VR Juggler</h1>




<p>
<h2>How draw, frame, and init routines differ between CAVElib and VR Juggler:</h2>
<li>In CAVElib(TM) these routines are "called-back" using function pointers (C-style).
<li>In VR Juggler, these routines are "called-back" using an application object, a C++ class which defines these
methods to encapsulate the functionality of the application within one C++ class object.<BR>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Detail Comparison:</h3>
<li>In CAVElib(TM)
<ul>
  <li>- An application's display callback function is defined by passing a function pointer to CAVEDisplay(). 
  <li>- The frame function is defined with CAVEFrameFunction(). 
  <li>- The initialization callback is defined using CAVEInitApplication(). 
</ul>

<li>In VR Juggler, you derive a new application class from vjGlApp (for OpenGL, vjPfApp for Performer) <BR>
  NOTE that no C-style function pointers are nessesary.
<ul>
  <li>- an application's display callback function is defined by simply writing a method of your derived
    class called draw().
  <li>- The frame function is split across 3 functions 
  <ul>
    <li>  - yourDerivedApp::preFrame (called before draw)
    <li>  - yourDerivedApp::intraFrame (called during draw)
    <li>  - yourDerivedApp::postFrame (called after draw)
  </ul>
  <li>- The initialization callback is defined with yourDerivedApp::init()
</ul>
