<p>Figure 1: Application object and virtual platform</p>
<h2>All VR Juggler apps are objects</h2>
<p>In VR Juggler, all applications are objects. &nbsp;VR Juggler uses the 

application object to create the VR environment in which the user interacts. &nbsp;The 

application object implements interfaces needed by the VR Juggler virtual platform to create the virtual environment. &nbsp;(An interface is a collection of operations used 

to specify a service of a class or a component)</p>
<h3>No main() - Don't call me, I'll call you</h3>
<p>Since VR Juggler applications are objects, developers do not write a main() function. &nbsp;Instead, developers create an application object that implement a set of pre-defined interfaces.&nbsp;
The VR Juggler kernel controls the
application's processing time by calling the application object's
implementations of the pre-defined interfaces. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
In common programs, the main function signals the point where the thread of control enters the application.
After the main function is called, the application starts performing any application processing necessary. 
When the OS starts the program, it gives the main function some processing time.
After the process's quantum expires, the operating system performs a context
switch and by switching to another process.</p>

<p>

In VR Juggler, we accomplish the same functionality in a slightly different way. &nbsp;The
applications correspond to processes in a normal operating system.&nbsp; The kernel
is the scheduler, and it allocates processing time to an application by 
invoking the methods of the application object. &nbsp;Because the kernel has additional information 
about the resources needed and used by the applications, it maintains a very strict scheduling about when the application is granted processing 
time. This is the basis to maintain coherence across the system.</p>

<h3>Application objects derive from graphics API specific base classes</h3>

<p>Figure 2: vjApp hierarchy</p>
<p>The first step in defining an application object is to derive from the base classes that define the 

kernel and draw manager interfaces the 

application needs to implement. &nbsp;There is a base class for the interface that the kernel expects
(vjApp) and a base class for each draw manager 

interface (vjPfApp, vjGlApp, etc) (see Figure 2).</p>

<p>

The kernel interface defined in vjApp, specifies methods for initialization, shutdown, and to give the application processing 

time.</p>

<p>

The draw manager interface specified in vj*App classes, specifies the API
specific functions that are necessary to render the virtual environment. &nbsp;The interface 

has functions for drawing the scene and for initializing context-specific information.</p>

<p>

The system expects all applications to implement this set of methods that the kernel uses to interact 

with the application.</p>

<h3>Writing and application = Filling in the blanks</h3>

<p>To implement an application in VR Juggler, developers just need to &quot;fill
in the blanks&quot; in the expected application object interfaces.</p>

<p>The user only needs to provide implementation for the things that they want
to customize.</p>

<p>If an implementation is not specified, then a default implementation is
used.&nbsp; In most cases, this default implementation does nothing.</p>
