<h2>What are the benefits of application objects<br>
(ie. why application objects)?</h2>

<p>The most common approach for VR application development is to have the application define the main function 

and have the application 

call library functions when needed. &nbsp;The library in this model only executes code when requested 

to do so by the application because the 

application is in control of the main thread of execution. This model makes the application developer 

responsible to coordinate the execution 

of the different components of the VR system and, therefore, responsible to create efficient, complex 

applications.</p>

<h3>Allow flexibility for run-time changes</h3>

<p>VR Juggler, being a virtual platform, does not use this model because it needs to maintain control over 

the different components to provide the 

flexibility needed to make changes to the virtual platform at run-time.</p>

<p>

By being in control of the execution, the kernel always knows the current state of the applications, 

therefore it can safely manage the run-time reconfigurations of the virtual environment. Under this 

model, nearly every parameter to configure the execution environment can be 

changed at run time. &nbsp;It is possible to switch applications, start new devices, reconfigure devices, 

and send reconfiguration information to the 

application object. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Low coupling</h3>

<p>

Application objects lead to a robust architecture as a result of low coupling and well defined inter-object 

dependencies. &nbsp;The application interface defines 

the only communication path between the application and the virtual platform. By restricting interactions 

to the interfaces of the kernel, draw manager, 

and application, the system restricts object inter-dependencies to those few interfaces. &nbsp;This 

decreased coupling allows changes in the system to stay 

local. &nbsp;Changes to one object will not affect another unless the change involves a change of the 

interface of one of the objects. &nbsp;This leads to more robust 

and extendable code.</p>

<p>Because the application is simply an object, it is possible to dynamically load and unload applications 

at run-time. &nbsp;When the virtual 

platform starts up, it waits for an application to be passed to it. When the application is given to 

the VR Juggler kernel at run-time, the kernel 

performs a few initialization steps, and then executes the application.</p>

<h3>Allows implementation changes</h3>

<p>

Since applications use a distinct interface to communicate with the virtual platform, changes to the 

implementation of the virtual platform 

do not affect the application. &nbsp;This makes it simple to make significant changes to the implementation 

of the virtual platform without affecting 

any applications that currently run on the platform. &nbsp;These changes could include bug fixes, performance 

tuning, new device support, or any 

number of other changes.</p>

<p>

We believe that this ability to modify the system's behavior at run-time is one of the major strengths 

of VR Juggler.</p>
