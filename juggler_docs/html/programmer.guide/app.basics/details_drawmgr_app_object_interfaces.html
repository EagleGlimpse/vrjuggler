<h2>Draw Manager

specific app classes</h2>
<p>The application classes are extended for each of the specific draw managers. &nbsp;The
graphics API specific application classes derive from vjApp and extend this
interface further by add extra hooks that support the abilities of the graphics
API.</p>
<h3>OpenGL application class</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/myAppHierarchy-highlightVjOglApp.gif"></p>
<p>The OpenGL application base class adds several functions to the interface
that allow applications to render OpenGL graphics.</p>
<h5>vjGlApp::draw()</h5>
<p>The draw function is called by the draw manager when it needs to draw the
current scene in an OpenGL window.&nbsp; It is called for each OpenGL context.</p>
<p>The vjGlApp interface is discussed further in later sections.</p>
<h3>Performer application class</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/myAppHierarchy-highlightVjPfApp.gif"></p>
<p>The Performer application base class adds interface functions that are used
to deal with Performer scene graphs.</p>
<h5>vjPfApp::initScene()</h5>

<p>The initScene function is called when the application should create the scene
graph that it is going to use.</p>

<h5>vjPfApp::getScene()</h5>

<p>The getScene() function is called by the Performer draw manager when it needs
to know what scene graph it should render for the application.</p>
<p>The vjPfApp interface is discussed further in later sections.</p>
