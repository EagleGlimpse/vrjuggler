<h1>Creating OpenGL Applications&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>What does an OGL app look like?</h2>
<p>An OpenGL base VR Juggler application must be derived from vjGlApp which is
in turn derived from vjApp.&nbsp; As was discussed in the application object
section, vjApp defines the base interface that VR Juggler expects of all
applications.&nbsp; The vjGlApp class extends this interface by adding members
that the VR Juggler OpenGL draw manager needs to correctly render an OpenGL
application.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="${PROGRAMMERGUIDE}/images/myAppHierarchy-highlightVjOglApp.gif"></p>
<p>The diagram above shows the functions that are added by the vjGlApp
interface.&nbsp; Namely: draw(), contextInit(), and contextPreDraw().</p>
<p>These functions deal with OpenGL drawing and managing context specific data
(don't worry if you don't know what context data is, we will cover that in
detail later).&nbsp; There are a few other functions in the interface, but these
cover 99% of the issues that most developers run into.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will describe how to add OpenGL drawing to an
application and how to handle context specific data.&nbsp; There is also an
tutorial for each topic.</p>
