<h2>OpenGL drawing - vjGlApp::draw()</h2>
<p>The most important (and visible) component of most OpenGL applications is the
OpenGL drawing.&nbsp; The vjGlApp class interface defines a draw() member
function to hold the code for drawing a virtual environment.</p>
<p>Any OpenGL drawing calls should be placed in the vjGlApp::draw() function of
the user application.&nbsp; Adding drawing code to an OpenGL base VR Juggler
application is a straight forward.</p>
<p>This function is called whenever the OpenGL draw manager needs to render a
view of the virtual world created by the user's application.&nbsp; It is called
for each defined OpenGL context, and it may be called multiple times per frame
in the case of multi-surface setups and/or stereo configurations.</p>
<p>Applications should <b>never</b> rely upon the number of times this function
is called per frame.</p>
<p>When the function is called, the OpenGL model view and projection matrices
have been configured correctly to draw the scene.</p>
<p>Input devices are guaranteed to be in the same state (position, value, etc)
for each call to this function for a given frame.</p>
<h3> What should you do here</h3>
<p>The only code that should execute in this function is calls to OpenGL drawing
routines.&nbsp; It is permissible to read from input devices to determine what
to draw, but application data members should not be updated in this function.</p>
<h3>What should you not do here</h3>
<p>This function should not be used to perform any time consuming computations.</p>
<p>Code in this functions should not change the state of any application
variables.</p>
