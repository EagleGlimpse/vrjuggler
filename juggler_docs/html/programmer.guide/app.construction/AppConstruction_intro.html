<h1>Application construction</h1>
<p>This part of the documentation comprises the main bulk of information about application
development. &nbsp;The section is structured around the types of application that may need to be
constructed.</p>
<p>The chapters each outline one area of interest for application
developers.&nbsp; For example, there are chapters that show how to get input from the system and
chapters that show how to write
applications for each of the currently supported graphics APIs.</p>
<p>Please note that when writing an application, there will be overlap between
these chapters.&nbsp; For example if you want to
have input, sound, and OpenGL graphics in an application then your application
will be based on concepts from each of those chapters.</p>
