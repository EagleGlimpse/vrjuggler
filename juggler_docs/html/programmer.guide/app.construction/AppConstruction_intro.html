<p>This section comprises the main bulk of information about application
development. &nbsp;It shows how to get input from the system and how to write
applications for each of the currently supported graphics APIs.</p>
<p>The section is structured around the types of application that may need to be
constructed.</p>
<p>[There may be overlap between the sections.&nbsp; For example if you want to
have input, sound, and OpenGL graphics in an application]</p>
