<h2>Getting input from VR Juggler</h2>
<h3>Use helper classes</h3>
<p>VR Juggler maintains a set of named devices. &nbsp;Each of these devices is
running in their own thread and is executing asynchronously from the rest of the
system. &nbsp;Once each frame, the kernel updates a local copy of the input data
for applications to use. &nbsp;To access the devices, applications must make use
of a device handle to a named device.</p>
<p>Every time an application receives device data, it must use this handle.
&nbsp;As shown in { REF _Ref465158845 \h }Figure 7, the mWand data member is a
device handle. &nbsp;It is initialized by passing the name of the device it
references to the init() method. &nbsp;Then to use the device in an application,
the getData() method is called which returns a reference to the type of data
that the device supports. &nbsp;In this case, mWand-&gt;getData() returns a
reference to a vjMatrix because the &quot;VJWand&quot; is a positional device.</p>
<p>Because all devices are accessed through device handles, VR Juggler has
flexibility in how the devices in the system are handled and how the device data
is returned. &nbsp;The device a handle refers to can be changed at run-time.
&nbsp;This change can occur without the application ever knowing it took place.</p>
<h3>How does an app get input&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Where should input be handled</h3>
<p>Latency critical should be in preFrame()</p>
<p>Computations based upon input should be in postFrame()</p>
