<h2>Getting input from VR Juggler</h2>
<h3>How does an app get input?</h3>
<p>There are many types of input devices that VR Juggler applications can use,
positional, digital, analog, and quite a few more.&nbsp; But the process and
concepts about how to get input from all these devices is exactly the same in
all applications.</p>
<p>The primary thing to remember about getting input in applications is that all
VR Juggler applications receive input through device handles that are managed by
vjDeviceInterfaces .&nbsp; There are vjDeviceInterfaces for each type of input
data that VR Juggler can handle.&nbsp; There is one of positional input, one for
analog, and so on.&nbsp; The all have very similar interfaces and behave exactly
the same.&nbsp; (please see <a href="../../helper.classes/vjDeviceInterface.html">vjDeviceInterface</a>
for details)</p>
<h3>Show me the code</h3>
<p>So, what does the code look like for getting device input using these device
interfaces.&nbsp; Since all device interfaces look the same, I will just give an
example of getting positional input.&nbsp; All other types are very similar.</p>

<pre>class myApp : public vjApp
{
public:
   init();
   preFrame();
private:
   vjPosInterface mWand;
}</pre>

<p>The first thing that has to be added to an application is the variable that is the actual device interface.  Usually they are member variables of the user application class.&nbsp;
This is how mWand is declared above.

<pre>myApp::init()
{
   mWand.init(&quot;NameOfPosDevInConfiguration&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>The device interface has to be told what device it is getting data from, this is done by calling the init() function with the string name of device that the interface should get data from.  This device name comes from the active configuration.
<p>

So, now we know how to declare a device interface and how to initialize it.  How do we actually use it???
<pre>...
vjMatrix wand_pos;
wand_pos = *(mWand-&gt;getData());
...</pre>

<p>This code shows an example of using the device interface in an
application.&nbsp; It shows some sample code where the application copies the
positional information from a device interface.&nbsp; When it is dereferenced,
the device interface figures out what device it is pointing to and returns the
data from that device.</p>
<p>Once again, please see <a href="../../helper.classes/vjDeviceInterface.html">vjDeviceInterface</a>
for much more complete details on how to use vjDeviceInterfaces.</p>
