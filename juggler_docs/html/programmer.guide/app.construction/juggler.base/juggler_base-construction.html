<h1>Juggler base application construction</h1>

<h2>Application object</h2>

<p>As was described in previous sections (see <a href="../../app.basics/application_objects_overview.html">app
object</a>), all VR Juggler applications derive from a base VR Juggler application
object class (vjApp).&nbsp; This class defines the basic interface that VR
Juggler expects from all application objects.</p>

<p>This means that when constructing an application, the user defined
application object must inherit from a class either vjApp or a draw manager
specific application class that has vjApp as a superclass.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>class userApp : public vjApp
{
public:
   init();
   preFrame();
   postFrame();
}</pre>

<p>This defines a new application class (userApp) that can be used anywhere that
VR Juggler expects an application class.</p>

<h2>Draw manager specific application classes</h2>

<p>A user application does not have to (and in most cases does not) derive from
vjApp.&nbsp; In most cases, an application class is actually derived from a draw
manager specific application class.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>class userGlApp : public vjGlApp
{
public:
   init();
   preFrame();
   postFrame();
   
   draw();
}</pre>

<p>This user application is an OpenGL application.&nbsp; The application class (userGlApp)
has derived directly from the OpenGL draw manager specific vjGlApp application
base class.&nbsp; This class provides extra definitions in the interface that
are custom for OpenGL applications.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../app.basics/details_base_app_object_interface.html">base VR Juggler interface</a>
for more details.</p>
