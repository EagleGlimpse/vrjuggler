<h3>Linking to Dynamic Shared Objects</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default Juggler is setup to link to dynamic shared object libraries. (dso's) what
  this means is that instead of including all the juggler object code into each executable
  compiled, the Juggler object code is dynamically linked at runtime.&nbsp; This greatly
  decreases the size of the executable files generated.</p>
  <p>In order for dynamic linking to work, there are some environment variables that need to
  be set to tell the dynamic linker where to look for the dso's.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>For N32:</strong> setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib32<br>
    <strong>For 64:</strong> setenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib64</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Once these variables are set, the dynamic linker will be able to find where the Juggler
  libraries are located.</p>
