<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There a few things needed to get started using VR Juggler.</p>

<H3> Required Reading: </H3>
<ul>
<li> A book on C++ and object oriented design </li>
<li> A book(s) about Juggler's supported graphics API(s). (OpenGL Red Book, <a href="http://techpubs.sgi.com">Performer manual</a>, etc...)</li>
</UL>

<h3><strong>Environment Variables</strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The environment variable VJ_BASE_DIR must be set to the base directory of the installed
  Juggler library.&nbsp; This tells the kernel and the config editor where to find data
  files needed to run the system.</p>
  <p>Ex. setenv VJ_BASE_DIR /home/software/Juggler/beta-0.1</p>
  <p>In order to run the Java based config editor, the environment variable JDK_HOME must be
  set to tell the system where Java is located.</p>
  <p>Ex. setenv JDK_HOME /user/java</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Search Path</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The search path must have VJ_BASE_DIR/bin added to it in order for the java programs to
  be found correctly.&nbsp; The following line will add the correct path to the user search
  path.</p>
  <p>set path = ( $VJ_BASE_DIR/bin $path )</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Linking to Dynamic Shared Objects</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default Juggler is setup to link to dynamic shared object libraries. (dso's) what
  this means is that instead of including all the juggler object code into each executable
  compiled, the Juggler object code is dynamically linked at runtime.&nbsp; This greatly
  decreases the size of the executable files generated.</p>
  <p>In order for dynamic linking to work, there are some environment variables that need to
  be set to tell the dynamic linker where to look for the dso's.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>For N32:</strong> setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib32<br>
    <strong>For 64:</strong> setenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib64</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Once these variables are set, the dynamic linker will be able to find where the Juggler
  libraries are located.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Config files</strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Juggler requires config files in order to setup the system.&nbsp; In the current version of the library, config files are
  passed to the application as a parameters.&nbsp; By default, these config files
  are located in the users home directory in the <strong>~/.vjconfig</strong>
  subdirectory.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Each release starting with alpha 4
  includes sample config files that may be copied to the users <strong>~/.vjconfig</strong>
  directory to be used as a starting point for customization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Sample config files</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sample files are located in <strong>VJ_BASE_DIR/Data/configFiles</strong>. &nbsp;
  (Where VJ_BASE_DIR is the base directory for the Juggler release being used.)&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In order to get started using Juggler quickly, you should copy all the
  config files from the configFiles directory into your local ~/.vjconfig
  directory.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE</b>: You are not required to use the default configuration
  files.&nbsp; You are encouraged to customize them to suit your individual
  tastes and needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Editing config files</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The juggler GUI controller (vjcontrol)&nbsp; is used to edit the config files used by
  VR Juggler. &nbsp; The following link gives more information about the config system.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="../config/config_main.htm">Main config page</a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Sample code</strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are sample applications located in the &quot;test&quot; directory in the
  installed Juggler area (VJ_BASE_DIR). Users can copy these files into there local home
  directories in order to compile them.&nbsp; Each application is in a separate directory and
  has a makefile that will compile the application.</p>
  <p>NOTE: Currently there are also internal test programs in the test directory.&nbsp; In
  the future there will be a samples directory with only sample applications.&nbsp; The
  directories that contain sample applications are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ogl/wand</li>
    <li>ogl/cubes</li>
    <li>ogl/simpleGlove</li>
    <li>ogl/torus</li>
    <li>ogl/glove</li>
    <li>ogl/combo</li>
    <li>pfNav</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Executing the test code</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>All of the test programs take a config file as a parameter.&nbsp; For example to run
  the cubes application a user would type:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="System">cubes ~/.vjconfig/sim.base.config ~/.vjconfig/sim.wand.mixin.config</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Some of the applications need access to VJGlove, which is an alias for a
  glove device.&nbsp; For these programs you also need to specify the <font size="2"><b>~/.vjconfig/sim.glove.mixin.config</b>
  </font>file.</p>
  <p>If the program complains about not being able to find the runtime libraries it needs,
  see the section above about dynamic shared objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>What now?</strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once your environment has been configured to run Juggler applications, it is time to
  start learning the development system.&nbsp;
