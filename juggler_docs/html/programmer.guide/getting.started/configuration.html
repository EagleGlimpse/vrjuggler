<h3><strong>Config files</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Juggler requires config files in order to setup the system.&nbsp; In the current version of the library, config files are
  passed to the application as a parameters.&nbsp; By default, these config files
  are located in the users home directory in the <strong>~/.vjconfig</strong>
  subdirectory.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Each release starting with alpha 4
  includes sample config files that may be copied to the users <strong>~/.vjconfig</strong>
  directory to be used as a starting point for customization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Sample config files</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sample files are located in <strong><a href="environment.variables.html">VJ_BASE_DIR</a>/Data/configFiles</strong>. &nbsp;
  (Where <a href="environment.variables.html">VJ_BASE_DIR</a> is the base directory for the Juggler release being used.)&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In order to get started using Juggler quickly, you should copy all the
  config files from the configFiles directory into your local ~/.vjconfig
  directory.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE</b>: You are not required to use the default configuration
  files.&nbsp; You are encouraged to customize them to suit your individual
  tastes and needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Editing config files</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The juggler GUI controller (vjcontrol)&nbsp; is used to edit the config files used by
  VR Juggler.
