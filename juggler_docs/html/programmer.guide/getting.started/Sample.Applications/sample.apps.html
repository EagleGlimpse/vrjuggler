<h2><img border=0 src="${IMAGES}/teddy3.gif"> Sample Applications</h2>

There are several <b>sample applications</b> supplied with Juggler.<BR>
You can use them to test and verify your installation.  
After that, you may want to edit them to get a feel for how they work.<BR>
<BR>
<img border=0 src="${IMAGES}/Icons/24x24_Images/Caution.gif">
For a complete understanding of Juggler, be sure to read through 
the Juggler online books.<BR><BR>

<p>Juggler includes sample applications located in the "samples" directory in the
installed Juggler area (<a href="environment.variables.html">VJ_BASE_DIR</a>). Users can copy these files into their local home
directories to modify and compile them.&nbsp; Each application is in a separate directory and
has a Makefile that will compile the application.</p>
<p>The directories that contain sample applications are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>samples/ogl/wand</li>
	<li>samples/ogl/cubes</li>
	<li>samples/ogl/simpleGlove</li>
	<li>samples/ogl/torus</li>
	<li>samples/ogl/glove</li>
	<li>samples/ogl/combo</li>
	<li>samples/pfNav</li>
</ul>
