<h2><img border=0 src="${IMAGES}/teddy3.gif"> Sample Applications</h2>

Use the sample applications supplied with Juggler to test and verify your 
installation.  After that, you may want to edit them and get a feel for how 
they work.  For a complete understanding of Juggler, be sure to read through 
the Juggler online books.<BR><BR>

<blockquote>
  <p>Juggler includes sample applications located in the "sample" directory in the
  installed Juggler area (VJ_BASE_DIR). Users can copy these files into their local home
  directories to modify and compile them.&nbsp; Each application is in a separate directory and
  has a Makefile that will compile the application.</p>
  <p>The directories that contain sample applications are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ogl/wand</li>
    <li>ogl/cubes</li>
    <li>ogl/simpleGlove</li>
    <li>ogl/torus</li>
    <li>ogl/glove</li>
    <li>ogl/combo</li>
    <li>pfNav</li>
  </ul>
