<h2><img border=0 src="${IMAGES}/classes.gif">Environment Variables</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>A number of environment variables affect the way VR Juggler works.  Some 
of these are required to compile and run applications, while others are 
optional.  This page lists all of these environment variables.
<p>The syntax for setting or changing an environment variable varies with 
operating systems and shell interpreters.  This page assumes the syntax
used by C-style shells (for example, csh or tcsh).  Please refer to the
documentation for your shell for more information about how to set,
reference and modify environment variables.

<P>
  <strong>Note for Win32 users using DOS shells:</strong> The typical syntax
  for setting an environment variable from the command line under Windows is:

<PRE>
    &gt; <B>set&nbsp;VARIABLE_NAME=value</B>
</PRE>

  Here, <TT>VARIABLE_NAME</TT> is the name of the environment variable to
  be set.  To view the values of environment variables, just enter
  <TT><B>set</B></TT>; for the value of a single variable, enter
  <TT><B>set&nbsp;VARIABLE_NAME</B></TT>.  For more information, refer to
  the Windows online documentation about environment variables.
</P>

<h3>Required Environment Variables</h3>

<h4>VJ_BASE_DIR</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The environment variable VJ_BASE_DIR tells a VR Juggler application 
where to find important data files, and is required to compile or run any
Juggler app.  It should be set to the base directory of the 
installed juggler library.
<p>For example, if you downloaded a Juggler tar file and extracted it to
the directory /home/software/, you would set VJ_BASE_DIR with this command:
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;VJ_BASE_DIR&nbsp;/home/software/vrjuggler-0.1.95</tt>
<p>The last component of the above example depends on the particular version
of Juggler you've downloaded.
<p>If you downloaded and built VR Juggler from the source code, the 
compilation creates a directory called <tt>instlinks</tt> which can be used
as a Juggler base:
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;VJ_BASE_DIR&nbsp;~/my_build_dir/instlinks</tt>

<P>In either case, on a Win32 platform, you should use <TT>/</TT>'s as the
path separator for VJ_BASE_DIR rather than <TT>\</TT>'s.  The compiler tools
can handle either, and the utilities in <TT>juggler-tools</TT> will behave
much better if UNIX-style paths are used.  It is safe to use the drive
letter at the start of the path (e.g.,
``<TT>C:/software/vrjuggler-0.1.95</TT>'').
</blockquote>

<h4>JDK_HOME</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The JDK_HOME environment variable is required by the script that starts 
VjControl, the VR Juggler configuration program.  If Java is installed on your
system, JDK_HOME may already be set.  If not, it needs to be set to the base
of the Java installation.

<p>Ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;JDK_HOME&nbsp;/usr/java</tt>
</blockquote>

<h4>LD_LIBRARY_PATH  (UNIX/Linux only)<br>
LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH  (IRIX only)<br>
LD_LIBRARY64_PATH  (IRIX only)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Unix/Linux systems use these environment variables to find dynamically-loaded
libraries, such as libJuggler.so.  Unless you're building everything with
static libraries, you will need to set these to include the Juggler library
directory (under $VJ_BASE_DIR).
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> if the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is already defined, you do
not want to destroy the current value, just append the new path to it.  
Otherwise something else could stop working.

<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&nbsp;$VJ_BASE_DIR/lib</tt>
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&nbsp;$VJ_BASE_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong> On some SGI systems, users of the MIPSpro compiler (version 7.3) will need to add another directory as follows: <br>
<p><tt>setenv&nbsp;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&nbsp;$VJ_BASE_DIR/lib:/usr/lib32/cmplrs</tt>

<p>Irix supports several Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs).  VR Juggler
supports the N32 and 64 formats.  There are different library path variables 
for each:
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH&nbsp;$VJ_BASE_DIR/lib32</tt>
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;LD_LIBRARY64_PATH&nbsp;$VJ_BASE_DIR/lib64</tt>

</blockquote>

<h3>Optional VR Juggler-related Environment Variables</h3>

<h4>PATH</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If you intend to use the VjControl program, you may want to add the 
$VJ_BASE_DIR/bin directory to your $PATH:
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;PATH&nbsp;$VJ_BASE_DIR/bin:$PATH</tt>
</blockquote>

<h4>VJ_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable can be used to control the amount of diagnostic information
a VR Juggler application outputs.  Its value is a number between 0
(only very important messages are printed) and 7 (vast amounts of data).
Nonhackers are advised to use levels 0 through 3, as higher debug levels
become increasingly cryptic and can <b>severely impact application performance</b>.
<font color=red>The default is level 1</font> - only errors and critical information is output.
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;VJ_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL&nbsp;1</tt>
</blockquote>

<h4>VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable can be used to control which components of VR Juggler are
allowed to output diagnostic data.  If for some reason you set 
VJ_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL to 5 or higher, this variable can be used to filter the
output.
<p>The value of VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES is a space-separated list of Juggler
debug component names (defined in $VJ_BASE_DIR/include/Kernel/vjDebug.h).
The default value is "DBG_ALL", which performs no filtering whatsoever.
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES&nbsp;DBG_ERROR</tt>
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES&nbsp;"DBG_KERNEL&nbsp;DBG_INPUT"</tt>
<p>ex.&nbsp;<tt>setenv&nbsp;VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES&nbsp;"DBG_CONFIGDB&nbsp;DBG_ENV_MGR"</tt>
