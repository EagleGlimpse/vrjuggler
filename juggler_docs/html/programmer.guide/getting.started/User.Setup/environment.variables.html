<h2><img border=0 src="${IMAGES}/classes.gif">Environment Variables</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>A number of environment variables affect the way VR Juggler works.  Some 
of these are required to compile and run applications, while others are 
optional.  This page lists all of these environment variables.
<p>The syntax for setting or changing an environment variable varies with 
operating systems and/or shell interpreters.  This page assumes the syntax
used by the popular csh shell.
<p><strong>Note for WinNT users:</strong> The typical syntax for setting an 
environment variable under Windows is: <tt>set VARIABLE_NAME=value</tt>
</blockquote>

<h3>Required Environment Variables</h3>

<h4>VJ_BASE_DIR</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The environment variable VJ_BASE_DIR tells a VR Juggler application 
where to find important data files, and is required to compile or run any
Juggler app.  It should be set to the base directory of the 
installed juggler library.
<p>For example, if you downloaded a Juggler tar file and extracted it to
the directory /home/software/, you would set VJ_BASE_DIR with this command:
<p>ex. <tt>setenv VJ_BASE_DIR /home/software/vrjuggler-0.1.95</tt>
<p>The last component of the above example depends on the particular version
of Juggler you've downloaded.
<p>If you downloaded and built VR Juggler from the source code, the 
compilation creates a directory called <tt>instlinks</tt> which can be used
as a Juggler base:
<p>ex. <tt>setenv VJ_BASE_DIR ~/my_build_dir/instlinks</tt>
</blockquote>

<h4>JDK_HOME</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The JDK_HOME environment variable is required by the script that starts 
vjcontrol, the VR Juggler configuration program.  If Java is installed on your
system, JDK_HOME may already be set.  If not, it needs to be set to the base
of the Java installation.

<p>Ex. <tt>setenv JDK_HOME /usr/java</tt>
</blockquote>

<h4>LD_LIBRARY_PATH  (UNIX/Linux only)<br>
LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH  (IRIX only)<br>
LD_LIBRARY64_PATH  (IRIX only)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Unix/Linux systems use these environment variables to find dynamically-loaded
libraries, such as libJuggler.so.  Unless you're building everything with
static libraries, you will need to set these to include the Juggler library
directory (under $VJ_BASE_DIR).
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> if the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is already defined, you do
not want to destroy the current value, just append the new path to it.  
Otherwise something else could stop working.

<p>ex. <tt>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib</tt>
<p>ex. <tt>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib $LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong> On some SGI systems, users of the MIPSpro compiler (version 7.3) will need to add another directory as follows: <br>
<p><tt>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib:/usr/lib32/cmplrs</tt>

<p>Irix supports several Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs).  VR Juggler
supports the N32 and 64 formats.  There are different library path variables 
for each:
<p>ex. <tt>setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib32</tt>
<p>ex. <tt>setenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/lib64</tt>

</blockquote>

<h3>Optional VR Juggler-related Environment Variables</h3>

<h4>PATH</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If you intend to use the vjcontrol program, you may want to add the 
$VJ_BASE_DIR/bin directory to your $PATH:
<p>ex. setenv PATH $VJ_BASE_DIR/bin:$PATH
</blockquote>

<h4>VJ_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable can be used to control the amount of diagnostic information
a VR Juggler application outputs.  Its value is a number between 0
(only very important messages are printed) and 7 (vast amounts of data).
Nonhackers are advised to use levels 0 through 3, as higher debug levels
become increasingly cryptic and can <b>severely impact application performance</b>.
<font color=red>The default is level 1</font> - only errors and critical information is output.
<p>ex. <tt>setenv VJ_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL 1</tt>
</blockquote>

<h4>VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable can be used to control which components of VR Juggler are
allowed to output diagnostic data.  If for some reason you set 
VJ_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL to 5 or higher, this variable can be used to filter the
output.
<p>The value of VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES is a space-separated list of Juggler
debug component names (defined in $VJ_BASE_DIR/include/Kernel/vjDebug.h).
The default value is "DBG_ALL", which performs no filtering whatsoever.
<p>ex. <tt>setenv VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES DBG_ERROR</tt>
<p>ex. <tt>setenv VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES "DBG_KERNEL DBG_INPUT"</tt>
<p>ex. <tt>setenv VJ_DEBUG_CATEGORIES "DBG_CONFIGDB DBG_ENV_MGR"</tt>
