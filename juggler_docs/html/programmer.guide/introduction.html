 <h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>

Welcome to the VR Juggler programmers guide.</p>

<p>

VR Juggler applications are not difficult to write once you understand the basics. &nbsp;The goal of 

this book is to introduce the basics that are 

needed and to give you experience along the way with hands-on exercises.</p>

<h2>Why should you read this book?</h2>
<p>Hopefully you are reading this book because you want to create cool and innovative new VR
applications that push the limits of today's technologies. &nbsp;VR applications
run the gamut from real-time entertainment applications to life saving medical
applications. &nbsp;The 

sky is the limit.</p>
<p>There are two groups of people who are probably reading this book.</p>
<p>First, there are those of you that are required to read it to do a project for work. &nbsp;To those 

of you in this category, I just want to say don't worry. &nbsp;VR 

Juggler is actually very simple to use after you get through the initial learning stages. &nbsp;it is 

a very powerful tool that will allow you to create 

interesting and powerful application very quickly.</p>
<p>The other group of readers are those of you that are just interested in creating cool VR applications. &nbsp;I can happily tell you that you have 

come to the right place. &nbsp;VR Juggler will allow you to create extremely powerful applications very quickly
that will run on nearly any hardware platform you 

would like.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Experience needed</h2>
<p>Before reading this book, you should have already completed the getting
started book and be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compile, configure, and run a VR Juggler sample application</li>
</ul>
<h3>Required background</h3>
<p>To get the most out of this book, there are a few prerequisites.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Programming experience using C++</li>
  <li>Some graphics programming background (OpenGL, Performer, etc)</li>
  <li>Reasonable mathematical background.</li>
</ul>
<p>

For some of the advanced sections of this guide, it is recommended that you have
read and understand the VR Juggler Architecture guide book as well.&nbsp; Don't
worry to much though because in places where this information is necessary we
will provide cross-references to the appropriate information.</p>

<h3>What if have used another VR software system?</h3>
<p>

If you already have experience with other VR software development environments,
you can easily skim through this book and cull out the relevant new
information.&nbsp; The book is designed for easy skimming. &nbsp;Just look at 

the headings and you should get a very good determination of what you should read and what you can skip 

over.&nbsp; I would highly recommend examining all of the tutorials in
detail.&nbsp; Then if there is something in the tutorial that you do not
understand, you can backtrack to find the appropriate information.</p>
<h2>How should you read this book?</h2>
<p>

This book is designed to allow reading from <b> cover to cover</b>. &nbsp;Each chapter builds on the information 

from the chapters before and expands the 

readers working knowledge of VR Juggler.</p>
<p>The book can also be used as a <b> reference</b>  for developers that have already acquired some general VR Juggler 

experience.</p>
<h2>Book Organization</h2>
<p>The programmer's guide is organized into 4 main sections. &nbsp;These sections are described below.</p>
<ul><li><b>Part I: Application basics<br>
    </b>

In this section you will be introduced to the key application development concept of VR Juggler: application 

objects. &nbsp;The information is 

needed in order to understand the rest of the book, so it is highly advisable to read this chapter even 

if you have experience with other VR 

software development environments.

<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Part II: Common helper classes</b><br>

This chapter describes some of the key classes that all applications make use of. &nbsp;These classes 

are used for math, input, etc.

<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Part III: Writing applications</b><br>

This section comprises the main bulk of information about application development. &nbsp;It shows how 

to get input from the system and how to 

write applications for each of the currently supported graphics APIs.

<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Part IV: Advanced Topics</b><br>

This section covers advanced topics that are not covered in the other sections. &nbsp;Included in these 

are the topics of: run-time reconfiguration, 

thread creation, and multi-threaded application development.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
