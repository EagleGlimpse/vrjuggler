<H3><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H3>

  <P>
    This whole proxy thing can be pretty confusing.  We admit that it
    makes the learning curve for VR Juggler a little steeper, but once
    you get, you will know it all.  An alternate title for this document
    is ``Horton Hears a Proxy.''  In this case, Horton is VR Juggler (it
    is rather elephant-like at times), and the complexity of dealing with
    these ethereal, ubiquitous proxies causes VR Juggler to take a lot of
    guff.  This document presents the <TT>vjProxy</TT> class, the base
    class for the input proxies making it the one that is used the most.
    It should be noted, however, that the concept is spreading to other
    parts of VR Juggler because it is so useful.  While this is only the
    introduction, we'll give you the moral of the story now: proxies are
    important concepts, and you shouldn't step on them.
  </P>

  <P>
    The class <TT>vjProxy</TT> is the base class for all the proxies in
    the VR Juggler Input Manager.  A better name would be
    <TT>vjInputProxy</TT>, and it may help to think of it with that name.
    As a programmer of VR Juggler applications, your knowledge of such
    proxies does not have to be terribly in-depth.  The fact is, you will
    probably never need to know more about a specific device proxy's
    interface than the return type of its <TT>getData()</TT> method.
    Most of the apparent complexity in the specific device proxy classes
    is only important to VR Juggler's internal maintenance of the active
    proxies.
  </P>

  <P>
    That being said, this document is going to be relatively short.  As
    a programmer, what you need to know is that a proxy is a pointer to
    a physical device.  You use the higher level
    <A HREF="${PROGRAMMERGUIDE}/helper.classes/vjDeviceInterface.html">device
    interface</A> as the mechanism to read data in some form from the
    device.  The device interface encapsulates some type of proxy that in
    turn points to an input device.  That device can be a wand, a keyboard,
    a light sensor, a Clapper, or a home-brewed device that reads some
    input and returns it to VR Juggler in a meaningful way.  That's a lot
    of indirection just to find out that Grandma is trying to turn on the
    lights in her bedroom, but it makes VR Juggler's handling of physical
    devices incredibly powerful.
  </P>

<H3><A NAME="use">Using <TT>vjProxy</TT></A></H3>

  <P>
    To be frank (or Bert), you don't use <TT>vjProxy</TT>.  You are given
    access to a subclass of it through a device interface acting as a
    smart pointer.  What you do use is the <TT>getData()</TT> method of
    that subclass.  That method is your window into the soul of an input
    device.  Trippy, no?  The device interface lets you call
    <TT>getData()</TT> for the specific proxy object it is hiding, and you
    can get the current state of the device pointed to by the proxy.
  </P>

  <P>
    Therefore, what you need to know is the return type of the specific
    proxy you get access to through the device interface.  The naming
    conventions for the proxies and their interfaces makes it relatively
    simple to determine which proxy object is being encapsulated by which
    device interface.  For example, a <TT>vjDigitalInterface</TT> has a
    <TT>vjDigitalProxy</TT> pointer.  You would then look up the
    documentation for the <TT>vjDigitalProxy</TT> class and find the
    return type of <TT>getData()</TT> (<TT>int</TT> in this case).  You
    can also look in the proxy header files, all of which are located in
    <TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/Input/InputManager</TT>, and search for the
    <TT>getData()</TT> method therein.
  </P>

  <P>
    There, now don't you feel good about these proxy things?  They're
    important concepts, aren't they?  You don't want to step on them.  
    You and the proxies can get along just fine because you understand
    them, and because you now know that they are there to help you make
    better software.
  </P>

<H3><A NAME="details">The Gory Details</A></H3>

  <P>
    The gory details of <TT>vjProxy</TT> and its subclasses are not really 
    relevant to this particular document.  Yes, the subclasses look
    complicated, and they can be.  It is important to note, however, that
    the complication is part of the interface used internally by VR Juggler
    rather than the interface used by the application programmer (that's
    you!).  Because of that and because each device proxy class is
    different, those details will not be addressed here.  It is sufficient
    to deal with <TT>getData()</TT> alone in your applications.  Leave
    the ugliness up to VR Juggler.  It can handle it.  It's cool like
    that.
