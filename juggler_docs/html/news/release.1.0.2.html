VR Juggler 1.0.2 released
</h3>

<p>
  The VR Juggler team is proud to make the official release announcement
  for VR Juggler 1.0.2.  This is a maintenance release to 1.0.1 released
  in June 2001.  It includes bug fixes related to POSIX threads, the
  trackd driver configuration, and VjControl active configuration updates.
  Users working with the POSIX threads versions of VR Juggler (those
  developing on Linux, HP-UX, Solaris, and IRIX without SPROC) or those
  using VjControl for dynamic reconfiguration are encouraged to upgrade.
</p>

<p>
  The full source code and pre-compiled binaries for IRIX 6.5 and Win32
  are available from the <A HREF="${DOWNLOAD}/index.html">download page</A>.
  Please review the RELEASE_NOTES for instructions on upgrading from
  previous beta versions of VR Juggler.  The KNOWN_BUGS file contains a

<p>
<B>Note for RedHat Linux users:</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Due to problems with OpenGL Performer 2.4 on RedHat Linux, we are
    unable to release a full binary version of VR Juggler for Linux.
    OpenGL-only VR Juggler applications are known to work on RedHat
    Linux 7.1 with GCC 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-81).
    Users of RedHat Linux 6.1 and 6.2 should experience no problems with
    VR Juggler using the default compilers.  We encourage Linux users to
    download the source code and compile it locally using the process
    documented in the README file.

<p><b>About VR Juggler</b><br>
VR Juggler is a virtual platform for VR application development. It provides
an object-oriented development environment that allows applicatinos to be
developed independently of the underlying technologies of the available VR
system.  VR Juggler's goal is to allow VR applications to be developed once
and run anywhere.  VR Juggler is designed with extendability and flexibility
in mind.

<p><b>Availability</b><br>
VR Juggler is available on IRIX, GNU-Linux, BSD, Solaris, HP, and Windows
NT/2000 platform.&nbsp; We are currently looking for parties interested in
testing VR Juggler on these platforms.  We welcome patches and additions
(bug fixes, input and output drivers, features, etc...) to the Juggler source.
We have a site on <a target="_top" href="${SOURCEFORGE}">sourceforge</a> as
a way to bring you the access to the latest source code via CVS, Juggler
forum, messaging, and bug tracking.
