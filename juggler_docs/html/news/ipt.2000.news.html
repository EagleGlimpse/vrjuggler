    <a target="_top" href="${VRAC}">VRAC</a>'s new 6 sided cave-like device named the <a target="_top" href="${C6}">C6</a>.  
    To show off this new system, applications written on top of the Juggler virtual platform (about 22 total) were demonstrated for the 300+ attendees.  
    Everything was a success: framerate was high, crashes were non-existent... . . . .

    <p>.  . . ...There were very few problems the only one being instability problems with our new wireless Motionstar tracking system.  As it turned out, it was a hardware bug and still suffers from occasional dropouts.</p>
    
    <p>Of special note, we ran every application within one reconfigurable application 
    (an at-runtime reconfigurable environment).  The architechture of Juggler allows you to do special things like switching and configuration of applications at runtime.  
    This demonstrates yet another facet of the Juggler Platform's
    usefulness over your typical VR device driver library.</p>
    
    <p> Also at the conference, two of our own Juggler team presented papers on two juggler features: Run-time reconfiguration by <a target="_top" href="${ALLENB}">Allen Bierbaum</a>, and performance monitoring by <a target="_top" href="${CHRISJUST}">Chris Just</a>.
