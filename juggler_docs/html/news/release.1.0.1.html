VR Juggler 1.0.1 released
</h3>

<p>
  The VR Juggler team is proud to make the official release announcement
  for VR Juggler 1.0.1 (``I Bent My Wookie'').  This is a patch release to
  1.0.0 released in April 2001.  It includes a major bug fix in the
  Ascension MotionStar driver and support for HP-UX 11.00.  Users with
  MotionStar systems are strongly encouraged to upgrade.
</p>

<p>
  The full source code and pre-compiled binaries for IRIX 6.5 and Win32
  are available from the <A HREF="${DOWNLOAD}/index.html">download page</A>.
  Please review the RELEASE_NOTES for instructions on upgrading from
  previous beta versions of VR Juggler.  The KNOWN_BUGS file contains a
  list of all bugs known at the time of release.  For the most up-to-date

  Juggler bug tracker</A>.

<B>Note for RedHat Linux users:</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Due to recent complications related to release of GCC 3.0 snapshots
    with RedHat Linux 7.0, we are unable to prepare a stable binary
    version of VR Juggler for Linux.  It is known that the default version
    of GCC that ships with RedHad Linux 7.0 will not compile VR Juggler.
    The recently released update to GCC 2.96.69 can be used to compile
    the VR Juggler libraries and OpenGL-based VR Juggler applications.
    Performer-based applications will not run if compiled with GCC
    2.96.69 due to problems with C++ constructs.  We hope that a future
    update to RedHat Linux 7.0 will provide a more stable compiler.
    Users of RedHat Linux 6.1 and 6.2 should experience no problems with
    VR Juggler using the default compilers.  We encourage Linux users to
    download the source code and compile it locally using the process
    documented in the README file.

<p><b>About VR Juggler</b><br>
VR Juggler is a virtual platform for VR application development. It provides an
object-oriented development environment that allows applicatinos to be developed independently
of the underlying technologies of the available VR system.  VR Juggler's goal is to allow 
VR applications to be developed once and run anywhere.  VR Juggler is designed with 
extendability and flexibility in mind.

<p><b>Availability</b><br>
VR Juggler is available on IRIX, GNU-Linux, BSD, Solaris, HP, and Windows
NT/2000 platform.&nbsp; We are currently looking for parties interested in
testing VR Juggler on these platforms.  We welcome patches and additions
(bug fixes, input and output drivers, features, etc...) to the Juggler source.
We have a site on <a target="_top" href="${SOURCEFORGE}">sourceforge</a> as
a way to bring you the access to the latest source code via CVS, Juggler
forum, messaging, and bug tracking.
