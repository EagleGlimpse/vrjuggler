VR Juggler 1.0.3 released
</h3>

<p>
  To kick of the holiday season, the VR Juggler team is proud to announce the
  release of VR Juggler 1.0.3.  This is a maintenance release to 1.0.2
  released in August 2001.  It includes bug fixes for vjMatrix construction,
  pfMatrix-to-vjMatrix conversion, and JDK 1.4 compatibility.  The
  OpenScenegraph support promised earlier has been delayed until version
  1.0.4 to resolve some multi-pipe bugs.
</p>

<p>
  The full source code and pre-compiled binaries for IRIX 6.5, RedHat Linux
  7.1, and Win32 are available from <A HREF="${DOWNLOAD}/index.html">the
  download page</A>.  Please review the RELEASE_NOTES for instructions on
  upgrading from previous versions of VR Juggler.  The KNOWN_BUGS file
  contains a list of all bugs known at the time of release.  For the most

<B>Note for RedHat Linux users:</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Due to problems with OpenGL Performer 2.4 on RedHat Linux, we are
    not building Linux versions of VR Juggler with Performer support.
    The OpenGL-only version built for RedHat 7.1 was compiled using GCC
    version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-96).  If there is a
    demand, we can build VR Juggler with OpenGL Performer 2.4 using the
    RedHat 6.2 compilers (2.95.3).  Use of the older compilers is the
    only way to use Performer on newer releases of RedHat.  Please refer
    to

<p><b>About VR Juggler</b><br>
VR Juggler is a virtual platform for VR application development. It provides
an object-oriented development environment that allows applications to be
developed independently of the underlying technologies of the available VR
system.  VR Juggler's goal is to allow VR applications to be developed once
and run anywhere.  VR Juggler is designed with extendability and flexibility
in mind.

<p><b>Availability</b><br>
VR Juggler is available on IRIX, GNU-Linux, BSD, Solaris, HP, and Windows
NT/2000 platform.&nbsp; We are currently looking for parties interested in
testing VR Juggler on these platforms.  We welcome patches and additions
(bug fixes, input and output drivers, features, etc...) to the Juggler source.
We have a site on <a target="_top" href="${SOURCEFORGE}">sourceforge</a> as
a way to bring you the access to the latest source code via CVS, Juggler
forum, messaging, and bug tracking.
