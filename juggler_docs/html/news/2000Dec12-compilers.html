  Compiler requirements update
</h3>

<p>
  As part of recent debugging efforts, we discovered problems with a
  version of the IRIX MIPSpro compilers.  Unexplained crashes were
  occurring deep in STL code, and it turned out to be a compiler-related
  bug.  On IRIX, please be sure you are using at least MIPSpro version
  <b>7.3.1.1m</b> when compiling any version of VR Juggler. Please visit
  SGI's
  <a target="NewWindow" href="http://support.sgi.com/colls/patches/docs/relstream/mipspro7.3.1.1m/mipspro7.3.1.1m.html">MIPSpro
  Maintenance Release page</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
  For other platforms, the current requirements are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Win32</b>: Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, service pack 3 or 4
      (there are reports that Visual C++ 5.0 SP3 will work too)
  <li><b>Linux (Red Hat 6.x)</b>: EGCS 1.1.2 (GCC 2.91) or GCC 2.95.2
  <li><b>Solaris 7</b>: GCC 2.95.2 or newer snapshot
</ul>

<P>
  For several months, the developers and users of VR Juggler had been
  experiencing odd, difficult-to-reproduce crashes with all types of
  applications.  Stack traces revealed that the crashes all occurred in
  various parts of C++ Standard Template Library (STL) code.  Because the
  crashes almost always occurred only on IRIX, the problems were even
  more confusing.  The enforcement of standard C++ (using <TT>-LANG:std</TT>)
  after the 0.1.97 release made the crashes much more frequent.
</P>

<P>
  In an effort to debug these problems, several tools were used to evaluate
  and verify memory usage within VR Juggler in August and September 2000.
  As a result, many, many memory errors (dangling pointers, null pointer
  dereferences, variables accessed before they were initialized, etc.) were
  found and fixed.  The STL crashes continued, however.
</P>

<P>
  Ultimately, it was determined that a bug in the compiler MIPSpro
  compilers was causing the STL crashes.  This was discovered by using
  the experimental <TT>iostream</TT> implementation from SGI and their
  latest STL code.  By backtracking through snapshots of this code, we
  determined that the problem had been fixed at least as early as March
  or April 2000.  Upgrading the MIPSpro compilers on the VRAC systems
  to version 7.3.1.1m fixed the problem, and we now require that all IRIX
  users have at least this version installed when compiling <I>any</I>
  version of VR Juggler.
