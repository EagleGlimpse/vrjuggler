<p><b>About VR Juggler</b><br>
VR Juggler is a virtual platform for VR application development. It provides an
object-oriented development environment that allows applicatinos to be developed independently
of the underlying technologies of the available VR system.  VR Juggler's goal is to allow 
VR applications to be developed once and run anywhere.  VR Juggler is designed with 
extendability and flexibility in mind.

<p><b>Availability</b><br>
VR Juggler is available on Irix, GNU-Linux, BSD, Solaris, HP, and Windows NT/2000
platform.&nbsp; We are currently looking for parties interested in testing VR
Juggler on these platforms.  We welcome patches and additions (bug fixes, input and output drivers, features, etc...) to the Juggler source.
We are setting up a site on <a target="_top" href="${SOURCEFORGE}">sourceforge</a> as a way to bring you the access to the latest source code via CVS, 
Juggler forum, messaging, and bug tracking.  We will make an announcement when <a target="NewWindow" href="${JUGGLER_SOURCEFORGE}">the Juggler sourceforge site</a> 
is fully functional.
