<p><b>About VR Juggler</b><br>
VR Juggler is a virtual platform for VR application development. It provides an
object-oriented development environment that allows applicatinos to be developed independently
of the underlying technologies of the available VR system.  VR Juggler's goal is to allow 
VR applications to be developed once and run anywhere.  VR Juggler is designed with 
extendability and flexibility in mind.


<p><b>Availability</b><br>
VR Juggler is available on the Irix, Linux, and Windows NT
platform.&nbsp; We have done preliminary work porting VR Juggler to Solaris and
HP/UX.&nbsp; We are currently looking for parties interested in testing VR
Juggler on these platforms.
