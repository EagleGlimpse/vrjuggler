VR Juggler is an extendable virtual platform for VR application development. It provides an
object-oriented development environment that supports the
efficient development of time-critical, interactive immersive
applications independently of the underlying
technologies of the available VR system. VR Juggler allows VR applications to be
developed once and run anywhere.

VR Juggler is available on the Irix, Linux, and Windows NT
platform.&nbsp; We have done preliminary work porting VR Juggler to Solaris and
HP/UX.&nbsp; We are currently looking for parties interested in testing VR
Juggler on these platforms.
