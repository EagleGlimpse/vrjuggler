What goes here?

Quick reference for developers, including auto-generated class 
documentation, faq's, etc...

<!-- You need to get the autogenerated documentation, and put it in 'classes'
     NOTE: There should be a script available to generate this file. 
     Look in the Juggler source tree at:  juggler/docs/Makefile

Steps to add documentation to an installed juggler_docs site
------------------------------------------------------------

   0) Clean out any generated files from
      juggler_docs/html/programmer.reference/classes and all subdirectories.
      How you do this is up to you, but keep in mind that CVS can be your
      friend.

   1) cd juggler/Docs

          OR

      cd <Juggler build directory>/Docs

   2) gmake doc-public

      [Wait for a really long time ...]

   3) cd ./public_doc

   4) tar cvf - . | ( cd <path...>/juggler_docs/html/programmer.reference/classes ; tar xpf - )

          OR

      cp -r . <path...>/juggler_docs/html/programmer.reference/classes

   5) cd <path...>/juggler_docs/install

   6) Run install-web

      [Wait for a really long time again ...]

   7) You're done!
