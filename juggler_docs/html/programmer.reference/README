What goes here?

Quick reference for developers, including auto-generated class 
documentation, faq's, etc...

<!-- You need to get the autogenerated documentation, and put it in 'classes'
     NOTE: There should be a script available to generate this file. 
     Look in the Juggler source tree at:  juggler/docs/Makefile 
-->


The Makefile is executed if the classes are not properly installed into the
classes directory. 
(see InstallOps.pm in the install dir, in the recurseDir function)
