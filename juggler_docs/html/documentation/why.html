<P>
You, as a part of the Juggler development team, should want to write 
great documentation.  Think of it as an investment to offload work.  
The more you educate everyone, the better they understand your stuff, 
the more likely that someone will spot your bugs, add new features, and 
most importantly use your feature, like you for it, and tell everyone about how cool you are.  
Do it for the people, but of interest to you is what you personally get back 
from writing documentation.  Not just overwhelming satisfaction for a job well
done, and not just an enormous lift of responsibility from not being the only 
one who understands that obfuscated code segment.  It clarifies your thought 
process, uncovers bugs in your own logic, and produces that same clarity in 
other people who then love you for it - and in turn want to help you by developing 
more features and hunt for bugs.

Don't be lazy, document.  It is vital to the success of <b>your</b>
project!
