<p>As with any great piece of software, VR Juggler is likely to have some bugs in it.
&nbsp; Knowing this, the developers have set up a bug reporting service.</p>

<p>This service allows VR Juggler users to report bugs and to suggest improvements.
&nbsp; When submitting reports, please follow the guidelines set forth and give the title
of the submission a prefix of &quot;todo:&quot; or &quot;bug:&quot; in order to facilitate
sorting of incoming submissions.</p>
