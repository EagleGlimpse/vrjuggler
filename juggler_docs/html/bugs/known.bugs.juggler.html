<h4>Beta 1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Killing the sample applications requires a Ctrl-C.&nbsp; This is because
    there is no device that is guaranteed to always be active.&nbsp; In a future
    update, the GUI will allow you to kill a running application.</li>
  <li>HMD support is not included in this beta.</li>
  <li>Performer runtime reconfiguration support is currently broken.</li>
  <li>Performer stereo is broken.</li>
  <li>The only tested glove device is the simulator glove device.</li>
  <li>Gesture recognition for non-simulated gloves is not supported.</li>
  <li>The immersion box driver does not recognize the port property.</li>
  <li>Removing a keyboard device crashes the system.</li>
  <li>String values with quotes are not allowed in the config system</li>
  <li>Config includes require absolute paths</li>
  <li>It is possible to dynamically reconfigure the system in such a way as to
    remove something that another object is dependant upon.&nbsp; This has
    undefined results... but usually it is very bad.</li>
  <li>It is beta software, so there are many memory leaks but there are no large memory
    leaks that we know of.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
</ul>
