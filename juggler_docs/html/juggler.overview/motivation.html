<h2>Motivation in creating VR Juggler</h2>
VR Juggler came out of our wide range of experiences with other VR 
tools.&nbsp; Each of the original developers of VR Juggler came from a 
background of several years of experience with other toolkits.&nbsp; The team 
had Dr. Carolina Cruz-Neira who was the original developer of the CAVE 
Lib.&nbsp; She was able to provide invaluable guidance based upon her 
experiences.
<p>Based upon our previous experiences we saw the following areas as being key
to a VR development environment.</p>
<h3>High Performance</h3>
<p>Performance is the key requirement of any VR system. VR applications are
&quot;user centered&quot;, therefore
the physical comfort and experience of the user is of vital importance.&nbsp; The experience of the user relies upon presenting an interactive and engaging
environment. If the performance of the
system is too low, the interactivity of the system becomes erratic
and can lead to disengagement from the application that significantly degrades
the experience of the user.</p>
<p>Current VR software systems have been successful at achieving good
performance. Unfortunately, many
of these systems do so while neglecting several fundamental needs of a software system such as: reusability,
extensibility, flexibility, portability, and robustness. In some cases, system
developers sacrifice these needs in an attempt to increase performance by tying
the software system as closely to
the hardware as possible. Another reason that current systems may not implement
these features is that it is much more difficult to design a system that
supports these features. Since
the primary focus of VR research to date has been hardware systems and not
software systems, these types of
features have not received the attention that they deserve in a VR software system.&nbsp;</p>
<p> We believe that a
high-performance VR software system does not need to sacrifice any of these
features in order to maintain high performance. In addition, we believe that
these features are vitally
important for creating a long lasting standard VR software system.</p>
<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<h4>Future technology</h4>
<p>Extensibility in a VR development environment allows user applications to
survive technological changes of
the future. Extensibility is required because the hardware and software tools
used for VR development change
rapidly. Researchers are constantly creating new VR hardware devices that
must be supported by development
environments. The development environment should not require a
programmer to re-write their application every time support for a new VR
hardware device is added.</p>
<h4>Application &quot;survivability&quot;</h4>
<p>If a development environment does not allow easy extension, then it becomes
difficult for users to write
applications that can survive into the future. To avoid rewriting applications
for new hardware, application
developers need the ability to write an application once and rely upon the VR
development environment to support
future hardware advances. Although it would be adequate to simply
require users to re-compile to get support for new hardware, it is better if the
users are not required to even
re-compile. In order to avoid the need for re-compilation, a development environment
must support dynamic extension.</p>
<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p>Extensibility of the software architecture is not enough. The software
architecture must also be flexible
enough to adapt to new requirements. Flexibility here refers to the ability of
the system to adapt to the
shifting configurations and changing requirements of a VR system. For example,
the development environment must
support multiple operating systems in addition to supporting many types
of graphics software and hardware.</p>
<h4>Scalable / Cross-VR System</h4>
<p>Development environments should not require developers to rewrite an
application for every type of VR
system. Instead, the software should adjust itself to the local VR system.&nbsp;
An application written in a 
simulator on a desktop PC should be able to scale (with no code changes) to a 
&quot;full&quot; VR system.</p>
<h4>Run-time changes</h4>
<p>Most current virtual 
reality (VR) systems do not allow users modify the system settings at run-time.
A user configures the system before running an application, and the 
configuration remains static for the duration of the application. The configuration is static because, these systems rely upon having all 
configuration information available when the application starts. If the user needs to change a system setting, they have to shutdown the 
running application, change the configuration parameters, and then restart the 
application with the new parameters. They 
may have to repeat these steps many times to get the system into the correct 
configuration.
</p>
<p>Run-time configuration is desirable because it allows the entire system to be
changed dynamically.&nbsp; This is a great aid during setup and test.&nbsp; It
allows allows users to performance dynamic performance tuning by reconfiguring
the system in an attempt to get better performance.</p>
<h4>Cross-platform</h4>
<p>VR Juggler is also flexible enough to address many cross-platform issues.</p>
<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p>We wanted an open source system that others could use and access feely.</p>
<h3>Allow community involvement</h3>
<h4>Extension and refinement</h4>
<h4>Peer review</h4>
