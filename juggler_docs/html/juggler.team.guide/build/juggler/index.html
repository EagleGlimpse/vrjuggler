  <P>
    Of particular interest, The VR Juggler project uses the autoconf utility
    to stay portable across platforms.  This means you will have to
    ``configure'' the project before you make it.  To make sense of this
    documentation, please understand the concepts listed in
    <a href="#required">Required Reading</a>.  Posting about these subjects
    to the mailing list will probably be ignored.
