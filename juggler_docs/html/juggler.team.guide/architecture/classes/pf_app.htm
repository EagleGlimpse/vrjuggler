<h3>Overview</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This class is the base class for all Performer applications.&nbsp; As such it deals
  with Performer specific features.&nbsp; Primarily this class adds the responsibility of
  handling a Performer scene graph.&nbsp; It also gives users the ability to over ride the
  channel draw function.</p>

<h3>Interface</h3>

<h4>virtual void initScene()</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Initialize the Performer scene graph.&nbsp; This is called after Performer has started.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>virtual pfScene* getScene() = 0;</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return the current scene graph that the Performer application is using. This function
  must be defined so that the performer draw manager can get a scene graph to draw.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>virtual void drawChan(pfChannel* chan, void* chandata)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Function called in the channel draw function to do the actual drawing</p>
  <p>Advanced users may want to overide this behavior for advanced rendering effects such as
  over-lays, or multi-pass rendering.&nbsp; See the Performer man pages about overiding the
  draw traversal function.&nbsp; This function is the draw traversal function but with the
  projections set correctly for the given display and eye</p>
