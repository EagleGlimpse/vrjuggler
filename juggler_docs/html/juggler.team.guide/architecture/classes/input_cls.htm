<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Input is managed by several components in VR Juggler.&nbsp; These components work
togethere to allow the application to work without being bound directly to specific
devices.</p>

<h3><a href="proxies.htm">Proxies</a></h3>

<p>Proxies provide a placeholder to another object.&nbsp; They present a general interface
to a device in a way that abstracts that actual physical device interface.</p>

<h3><a href="devInterface.htm">Device Interface</a></h3>

<p>A device interface is a &quot;smart&quot; object that talks to the input manager to get
the application the correct proxy for the device name they specify.&nbsp; The device
interface is initialized with the name of a proxy or proxy alias to interact with. &nbsp;
This is the object that the user applications actually use to access the devices.
