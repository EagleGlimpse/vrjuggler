<h3>Primary Classes</h3>

needs to know about.</p>

<p>These can be divided into a few main sections</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="krnl_cls.htm"><strong>Kernel</strong></a>: The main control system of Juggler</li>
  <li><a href="app_cls.htm"><strong>Application</strong></a>: The classes used to encapsulate
    applications</li>
  <li><a href="input_cls.htm"><strong>Input</strong></a>: The classes used to get device input</li>
  <li><a href="math_cls.htm"><strong>Math</strong></a>: The basic math classes used in Juggler</li>
</ul>

<p>Each page explains the general uses of the claass as well as gives a basic description
of the major member functions and their uses.</p>
