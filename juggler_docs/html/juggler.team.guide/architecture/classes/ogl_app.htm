<h3>Overview</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Users need to derive their OpenGL applications from this class.&nbsp; Then it is
  necessary to define any of the function from the vjApp class that are needed.&nbsp; In
  addition the user needs to add their OpenGL drawing code the the member function draw().</p>

<h3>Interface</h3>

<p>(All functions of base class vjApp)<br>
<a href="baseapp.htm">BaseApp Class</a></p>

<h4>virtual void draw()</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>This function is called to draw the scene.&nbsp; When it is called, the projection and
  modelview matrices will have already been set up with the correct viewing parameters.</p>
  <p>The user should put all drawing code here.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>virtual void contextInit()</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>This function is called immedately after a new context is created.&nbsp; It is called
  for each new context.&nbsp; Upon entry, the ogl context is set to the newly created
  context.&nbsp; This function should be used to initialize any context specific information
  the user requires.&nbsp; for example, display lists and texture objects are routinely
  initialized in this function.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>virtual void contextPreDraw()</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>This function is called once per frame for each context.&nbsp; When it is called, the
  OpenGL context is set to that of the current window being drawn.&nbsp; This function can
  be used for any context specific changes the application needs to make.&nbsp; This
  function should be used for things that need to happen every frame, but only once per
  context. &nbsp; Ex: Dynamically Create display lists<br>
