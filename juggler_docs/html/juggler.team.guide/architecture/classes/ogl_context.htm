<h3>vjGlContextData</h3>

<p>This class allows the user to specify a data type that contains data that needs to have
a context specific copy. For example a struct full of display list id's. The user passes
their user-defined data structure as the template parameter. The resulting object will be
a &quot;smart&quot; pointer to the context specific data to use.<br>
<br>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Classes used as the user-defined data structure, must provide a
default constructor used to initialize all of the copies of the data.</p>

<hr>

<h4>ContextDataType&amp; operator*()<br>
ContextDataType* operator-&gt;()</h4>

<p>These are the pointer operations that are defined on this class.&nbsp; They allow the
object to be treated as a &quot;smart&quot; pointer within the application.</p>

<p>The references returned are only valid during the draw function and the context
functions.&nbsp; Results are un-defined for all other functions.</p>
