<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Display Managers encapsulate all information about graphic windows,
displays, and windowing APIs. As with the Draw Managers, there are several kinds of
Display Managers, but only one is instantiated at any time. Whereas the choice of Draw
Managers is based upon the application, which Display Manager is chosen depends on the
windowing system used by the underlying architecture. For example, there are separate
display managers for Windows and for Unix machines using X. Unlike the Draw Manager, the
application never has direct contact with the Display Manager.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The information the Display Manager encapsulates includes the size,
location, graphics pipeline, and viewing parameters to be used. The exact details depend
on the underlying windowing system. For example, The X Display Manager understands about X
display names, like &quot;titanic:0.0&quot;.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Display Manager uses this information to create windows or open
displays, change video modes, and so on, as necessary. Control is then turned over to the
Draw Manager, which creates rendering contexts and then handles the actual drawing.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Display Manager can add displays to and remove them from a running
application without interruption, when ordered to by the Environment Manager.</P>
