Application Classes</H2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VR Juggler includes several application framework classes, one for each
available graphics API. The fundamental difference between them is which Draw Manager will
be instantiated. A developer creates a new application by choosing one of these framework
classes and creating a subclass of it. The framework includes functions for drawing frames
and performing and pre- and post-drawing computations, which should be filled in by the
developer.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The application only speaks directly to the Kernel, but function calls
in the Kernel&#146;s API give the application access to the Draw Manager, devices
controlled by the Input and Output Managers, and configuration information stored in the
Configuration Manager. </P>
