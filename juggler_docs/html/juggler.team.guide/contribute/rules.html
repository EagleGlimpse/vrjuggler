  <P>
    Now that you have decided that you're more than cool enough to contribute
    to VR Juggler, it is time for some ground rules.  These rules are here to
    help the committers take advantage of your help with maximum efficiency
    and speed, so please do your best to keep them in mind.
  </P>

<H4><A NAME="bugfix">Submitting Patches to Fix Bugs</A></H4>

  <P>
    The best way to do this is with a <A HREF="${SUBMITBUGS}">bug report</A>.
    Copies of bug reports go to
    <A HREF="${JUGGLER_DEV_MAILING_LIST}">vrjuggler-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</A>
    where they are seen by everyone subscribed.  Before submitting a bug
    report, however, please review the <A HREF="${JUGGLERBUGS}">open bugs</A>
    to verify that the bug you have found is not already reported.  If you
    have a fix for an open bug, attach your patch as a follow-up comment.
  </P>

  <P>
    If you have found an unreported bug, your bug report should contain the
    following information:

    <UL>
      <LI>
        Who you are (so we can give you credit if your patch is committed)
      </LI>
      <LI>
        The version of VR Juggler you are using
      </LI>
      <LI>
        The environment in which you are working (for example, operating
        system name and version, compiler version, etc.)
      </LI>
      <LI>
        A full description of the bug
      </LI>
      <LI>
        How to repeat the problem
      </LI>
      <LI>
        How to fix the problem (in other words, explain how your patch fixes
        the problem)
      </LI>
    </UL>
  </P>

  <P>
    The interested developer(s) will take responsibility for reviewing your
    patch and follow up with comments as appropriate.  If and when your
    patch is committed, you will be given due credit for the submission.
    Woo hoo!
  </P>

<H4><A NAME="feature">Submitting New Features, Implementing Missing
Features</A></H4>

  <P>
    If you have a new feature to submit for addition to VR Juggler, you have
    hit the big time, baby!  The best way to present what will most likely
    be a large patch is to post it on
    <A HREF="${MAILTO_JUGGLE_DEV_MAILING_LIST">vrjuggler-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</A>
    for review.  When doing this, please include the following information:

    <UL>
      <LI>
        A <I>full</I> description of your feature and how it works
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Some reasoning about why your feature should be added
      </LI>
      <LI>
        The patch itself as a text/plain attachment if possible (this makes
        it easier for us to apply the patch and test it out)
      </LI>
    </UL>

    Ideally, your patch will include fully documented code so that the
    developers do not have to read the code, get a good understanding of it
    and document it themselves.  Including documentation, therefore, is a
    big plus when trying to get something committed.  Hint, hint.
  </P>
