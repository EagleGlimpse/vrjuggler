<H2>Why is Juggler cool, why do I care?</H2>

  <p>
    VR technology as a whole is stagnating with its closed source solutions.  
    This means that anyone new to VR need to completely develop a new solution, 
    often inferior than others.  Releasing an open VR system is vital to 
    the development of VR.  Now instead of reimplementing VR systems, people
    can focus on implementing new VR ideas and methods all relying on 
    this standard technology to be there, and free from cost or legal ties.

<H3>Why Should I, an Intelligent, Helpful Person, Contribute to the
Development of VR Juggler?</H3>

  <P>
    Because VR Juggler will benefit from your efforts, that's why!  As an
    OpenSource project, we want your help, your input, your ideas, and
    most of all, your code contributions.  You don't have to be a hot-shot,
    fast CPUs, fast downloads programmer to contribute.  VR Juggler is a big
    project, and it is still growing.  Whether your background is in
    UNIX-based systems or Win32, you can help.  We want motivated, creative
    people to help us make VR Juggler the world's best virtual reality platform.
    If you're still not convinced, take a look at the rest of this page for
    some more motivation.
  </P>
  
<H3>I Want to Fix a Bug</H3>

  <P>
    Only the most trivial software is bug free, and VR Juggler is certainly
    non-trivial.  We do our best to track down and fix bugs, but our
    fly swatter is only so big.  If you find a bug, then by all means,
    <A HREF="${SUBMITBUGS}">submit a bug report</A> and give us a patch!
    Don't worry, we won't be too embarrassed.
  </P>

<H3>I Want to Add New Features</H3>

  <P>
    As with most projects, the features present in VR Juggler are those
    deemed necessary by the developers and users.  New features are added,
    but the developers with commit access only have so much time each day to
    devote to the advancement of the source.  With a growing user base and
    advances in the field of virtual reality, new features help everyone.
    If you have an idea or some earth-shattering code, we want to see it!
  </P>

<H3>I Want to Add Missing Features</H3>

  <P>
    Everyone in the field of virtual reality has differing ideas, goals and
    equipment.  If VR Juggler is to prove usable as the basis for advanced
    (and not-so-advanced) virtual reality applications, it will need to
    provide support for the needs of as many users as possible.  Getting to
    this point means that missing features need to be added by someone.
    Eventually, the current developers could find the time to meet
    everyone's needs, but those needs can be met faster with the help of
    contributors.
  </P>

  <P>
    The most obvious case of a missing features is a driver for Device X.
    VR Juggler provides a highly flexible mechanism for adding a device
    driver to the source.  If you have driver source code for a currently
    unsupported device, chances are that driver can be added to VR Juggler
    easily.
  </P>

  <P>
    Other examples of missing features can include a wide variety of
    extensions.  To save yourself time, it would be best to discuss your
    ideas in a public VR Juggler forum (insert vrjuggler-devel link) first
    so that you can get feedback on whether your ideas are applicable to
    the VR Juggler core or would be better suited to a higher-level tool.
  </P>

<H3>I Think the Current Developers are Overworked</H3>

  <P>
    The VR Juggler team loves what it does and is excited about VR Juggler
    and its continued development.  We are, however, a small group with big
    ideas and busy schedules.  We want your help because, with support from
    many bright, creative developers, we think that VR Juggler can achieve
    these big goals and more.
  </P>
