Become a VR Juggler Committer</H2>

  <P>
    We are interested in expanding the list of official VR Juggler team
    members (i.e., developers with commit access).  As an OpenSource project,
    VR Juggler is just getting started, but the current group has been
    working together successfully on the project for a long time.  As more
    people become interested in the project and in furthering its goals, we
    hope to see more and more people joining the VR Juggler team.
  </P>

  <P>
    If you are interested in getting commit access to the VR Juggler CVS
    repository, the best way to fulfill your interests is to
    <A HREF="${CONTACT_US_DIRECTLY}">contact us directly</A> and let us know
    you'd like to join.  If you have never contributed to VR Juggler before,
    you should provide us with some examples of your VR Juggler-related work
    or some basis for why you should be on the team.  We will review your
    request and get back to you promptly.  Remember, it's up to you to
    prove to us how you can make VR Juggler better by having full commit
    access.
  </P>

  <P>
    In the future, we would love to have the opportunity to invite people
    to join the team based on their contributions (which would be judged
    primarily on quality rather than on quantity).  As part of the process
    for reviewing submitted patches, we will be watching for promising
    developers around the world who we would like to see having full
    commit access to VR Juggler.
  </P>
