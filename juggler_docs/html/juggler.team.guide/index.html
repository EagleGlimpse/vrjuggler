<h2>Before Reading This Book</h2>
<p>
   By now you should have read the
   <a href="${GETTINGSTARTED}"><i>Getting Started Guide</i></a> so that
   you know about environment variables and about compiling VR Juggler
   applications.  This book is for those people who wish to go further
   with their VR Juggler work by contributing to the project and even
   becoming full-fledged developers with commit access.  It is expected
   that you already know about compilers and linkers and shells and most
   everything else developers of UNIX and Windows software deal with on a
   regular basis.
