<h2> CVS Reference Card </h2>

<pre>
NOTE: this doc describes how to use CVS in your own personal projects on an IRIX machine with a TCSH shell, 
      and is no way related to the vrjuggler project

NOTE NOTE: For a complete coverage on the CVS system visit the <a href="${CVS}">CVS homepage</a>

# Create your personal repository:
mkdir $HOME/CVSRepos

# set environment variables (put these in your .cshrc)
setenv CVSROOT $HOME/CVSRepos
setenv CVSEDITOR pico

# create a new project:
cvs import projectname username version1

# how to checkout a project:
cvs checkout projectname

# add a file to the repository
cvs add filename
cvs add *.cxx *.h
etc...

# remove a file from cvs
rm filename
cvs remove filename

# or be fancy:
alias cvsrm 'rm \!*; cvs remove \!*'

# to check-in your changes
cvs commit

# to sync your checked out project to what is currently in the repository
# this is real useful if you have multiple copies of your project
# or if you have multiple developers on the same code.
# NOTE: this will not kill any of your changes (very cool!)
#       cvs is smart. It is able to merge any changes with your current code
#       and does a good job of it.
cvs update

# to see differences between what you currently have and whats in the repository
cvs diff filename

# to get a copy of your project from some time ago.
cvs checkout -D "1 day ago" project
cvs checkout -D "2 days ago" project
cvs checkout -D "4 months ago" project

# ... 12 midnight GMT
cvs checkout -D "today" project

# ... now
cvs checkout -D "now" project




# to see all comments you've made (sort of an unorganized ChangeLog)
cvs log [files]

# show log for all subdirs under current dir.
cvs log

# local dir only, no recursion
cvs log -l
