<H4> Introduction </H4>
</a>
The Juggler Documentation project uses a few Perl scripts to generate and
install the documentation.  In addition, Juggler uses Perceps to 
auto-generate it's C++ Class reference.

IMPORTANT: To better understand what you're doing, please understand the 
concepts listed above in Required Reading.  

To view the documentation, you must first build it.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a> documentation. (Try doing a 'man' or 'info' on perl, there also is a good book by O'Reilly.)</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/tbryan/PERCEPS/">perceps</a> documentation (Used in juggler to autogenerate documentation for CPP classes).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/CVS">CVS</a> documentation (used for revision control, lets you directly check in and out source)</li>
</ul>

<H4> Building the project: </H4>
To view the documentation, you must first build it.  Many of the HTML files have
tags which web browsers cannot read - thus you'd get many broken links if you 
tried load the index.html locally.  The install script (in the install directory) 
will parse the documentation and install a viewable copy into a location of 
your choice.  (NOTE: you may have to install the docs into a web server to 
view, there have been some problems using the tree control locally)

Build the project by running "install-web.pl" from the install directory.
If you run this with a -z option, it will save your arguments in a script 
that you can then use to build the project (this is recommended).
