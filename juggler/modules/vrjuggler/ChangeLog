==[ 0.1.97 ]=========================
Jul-13-2000 cjust     Environment Manager works under NT
                      Config files can have includes for chunkdesc files
                      Config file includes now use relative paths correctly
                      Vjcontrol fixes for editing embedded chunks
                      Vjcontrol internal event architecture expanded
                      Vjcontrol componentization (partial)
                      Numerous fixes in ConfigChunkDB code
Jul-13-2000 allenb    Initial ChangeLog file started
Jul-11-2000 allenb    Rewrote the way that threads call self()
                      Rewrote thread specific data
                      Threads are now much faster (~10x)
Jul-07-2000 patrick   Debugging symbols are now compiled into object files on
                      Win32 which fixes long-standing (but unreported)
                      problems with linking Juggler applications.
Jun-23-2000 patrick   Set the stereo bit in an OpenGL window on Win32 if
                      stereo is enabled in the windwo's config chunk.
                      _OLD_TERMIOS is no longer set on IRIX.  The serial
                      drivers are using the latest termios functions.  This
                      code will probably not work on versions of IRIX before
                      6.5 as a result.
                      Added the new utility library Juggler_utils which is
                      required by most, if not all, applications after this
                      date.
