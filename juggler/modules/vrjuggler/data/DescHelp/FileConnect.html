    <td>
      Chunk token: ``FileConnect''<br>
      Defines an output (or, in the future, input) file for the VR Juggler
      Environment Manager.  Its most common use is to define a file which
      can be used as a destination for performance measurement data.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">
      <b>File Name</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Gives the pathname for this file.  Exactly what constitutes a valid
      name depends on the underlying file system.  On Unix systems, this
      might be something like "output_data" or
      "<tt>~cjust/tmp/perfdata.txt</tt>".
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">
      <b>Enabled</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Lets you turn this particular file on or off.  If Enabled is false,
      Juggler will not open the file and won't write anything to it.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">
      <b>Readable</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Currently, this should always be false.  Internally, Juggler has some
      ability to read instructions from files or pipes.  In the future, this
      may allow the use of input instruction files.
