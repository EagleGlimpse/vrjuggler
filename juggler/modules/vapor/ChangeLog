DATE       AUTHOR   CHANGE
---------- -------- -----------------------------------------------------------
2001-12-09 patrickh Disallowed the overriding of the VPR "domain" (the thing
                    that defines what sockets, threads, etc. to use) by user
                    code.  The class vpr::BaseIOStatsStrategy is now a
                    templatized class.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.5.0
2001-12-07 allenb   GUID now has a constructor that can use a dispatch tag
                    to specify that it should generate a new id an init time.
2001-12-05 allenb   GUID's default constructor now initialized it to NullGUID.
2001-11-21 allenb   Modified StatCollector to allow for time based and discrete
                    stat collection.
2001-11-20 allenb   Created standards StatCollector class for collecting
                    IO statistics.  Replaced the old BandwidthIOStats
                    collection method with the new collector class.
2001-11-15 allenb   Added valid() test function to thread functors.  The code
                    now tries to test for valid functors at thread creation.
                    Also added destructor that sets the internal values to ones
                    that can be easily detected by isValid().
2001-11-13 allenb   Changed the debug GUID category registrators to allow only
                    one registration of the GUIDs.  This means that the 
                    registration macro should only be used from .cpp files now
2001-10-12 allenb   Updated vapor debug to use GUIDs for category identifiers.
                    This allows other systems to extend the categories.
2001-09-23 patrick  Updated test suite to use CppUnit 1.6.0.
2001-09-12 alleb    Added wait interval to the cond var abstractions.
           patrick
2001-09-04 kevn     vpr::ReturnStatus::Success renamed to
                    vpr::ReturnStatus::Succeed; vpr::ReturnStatus::Failure
                    renamed to vpr::ReturnStatus::Fail.
2001-08-06 allenb   Test case for vpr::System added.
2001-08-06 allenb   Introduced Htonll and Ntohll.
2001-07-31 patrick  Fixed major problems with SocketImplBSD::isConnected() and
                    with FileHandleImplUNIX::is{Redable,Writeable}().  These
                    methods now work properly.
2001-07-27 patrick  Removed the compiler flags dealing with warnings from the
                    output of 'vpr-config --cxxflags'.
2001-07-24 allenb   Changed socket bridge templates to use boost::shared_ptr
                    to reference the impl sockets.  This change introduces
                    reference counting on the impl sockets and makes
                    memory management much easier to handle.
2001-07-24 allenb   Added destructor code to SocketNSPRImpl.
2001-07-23 allenb   Added vprTest::BoostTest for testing boost functionality
                    required for vapor and other Juggler libs.
2001-07-22 allenb   Replace vpr::Status with vpr::ReturnStatus
2001-07-21 allenb   Imported Boost 1.0.23. ( www.boost.org )
2001-07-20 patrick  The vpr::Socket connect() method now uses its timeout to
                    wait for the connection to complete on a non-blocking
                    socket.
2001-07-20 allenb   The broken semantics of vpr::SocketConnector when using
                    non-blocking sockets have been corrected.
2001-07-17 patrick  Read/write calls take a vpr::Uint32 for their by-reference
                    out parameter giving the number of bytes read or written.
2001-07-13 patrick  Read/write calls return vpr::Status::WouldBlock instead of
                    vpr::Status::InProgress for non-blocking configurations.
2001-07-12 patrick  The internal platform-specific I/O implementation classes
                    no longer inherit from vpr::BlockIO.
2001-06-28 patrick  Non-blocking socket support (mostly) added.
2001-06-25 allenb   Added timeout interval param to nearly every I/O
                    method in the library.
2001-06-24 allenb   Added vpr::Interval class
2001-06-21 patrick  Completed work needed to build a DLL on Win32.
2001-06-21 browner  Added a wrapper around the serial device API on Win32.
                    This completes what is needed to allow writing
                    cross-platform serial device drivers.
2001-06-20 patrick  Complete restructuring of the directory tree.  This
                    included the removal of the SharedMem directory, the
                    renaming of the directories Threads and Utils to Thread
                    and Util respectively, and the requirement of prefixing
                    all included VPR headers with "vpr/".  The module was also
                    renamed from vpr to vapor.  While all revision history has
                    been retained, no code checked out prior to the tag
                    POST_DIRECTORY_RESTRUCTURE will compile.
2001-05-22 patrick  Brought the termios wrapper up to speed with the changes
                    made to the Bridge pattern implementation.  Templates are
                    used now instead of pure virtual methods.
2001-04-20 allenb   NSPR subsystem extended to wrap NSPR sockets.
2001-04-19 patrick  Changed the socket classes using the Bridge pattern to use
                    templates rather than pure virtual methods.  This was done
                    to help with maintenance and with general performance.
2001-04-17 patrick  Using the version of the VPR directory in the VR Juggler
                    source tree as the basis, the code was broken into a
                    separtely evolving module.
