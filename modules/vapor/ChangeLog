2001-06-21 browner  Added a wrapper around the serial device API on Win32.
                    This completes what is needed to allow writing
                    cross-platform serial device drivers.
2001-06-20 patrick  Complete restructuring of the directory tree.  This
                    included the removal of the SharedMem directory, the
                    renaming of the directories Threads and Utils to Thread
                    and Util respectively, and the requirement of prefixing
                    all included VPR headers with "vpr/".  The module was also
                    renamed from vpr to vapor.  While all revision history has
                    been retained, no code checked out prior to the tag
                    POST_DIRECTORY_RESTRUCTURE will compile.
2001-05-22 patrick  Brought the termios wrapper up to speed with the changes
                    made to the Bridge pattern implementation.  Templates are
                    used now instead of pure virtual methods.
2001-04-20 allenb   NSPR subsystem extended to wrap NSPR sockets.
2001-04-19 patrick  Changed the socket classes using the Bridge pattern to use
                    templates rather than pure virtual methods.  This was done
                    to help with maintenance and with general performance.
2001-04-17 patrick  Using the version of the VPR directory in the VR Juggler
                    source tree as the basis, the code was broken into a
                    separtely evolving module.
