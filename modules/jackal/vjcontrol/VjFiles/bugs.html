<h2><img src="juggler.gif"></img>VjControl 1.0 Known Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>VjControl is perfect.  It has no bugs.  If in doubt, repeat this as a 
mantra until you believe.

<br><li>Changes made by editing description files (adding, removing, or editing
ChunkDescs) in the Description pane are ignored by the Configure pane.
If you modify a descriptions file in any significant way, you should save,
quit VjControl, and then restart to modify the chunks.

<br><li>Strings can't contain quotes (parsing bug).

<br><li>Various textfields will currently allow illegal input.  For the time
being, do not try to input a floating point number into a field expecting an int,
do not try to enter a string into a field expecting any kind of number, and
especially, <b>do not use quotes in strings</b> - this is a good way to screw up
your config file so that it'll have to be fixed by hand before VjControl can read
it.  (Solution: need to add input handlers to all the textfields).  Oh yea, and
any field labeled 'token' must not have spaces in it!

<br><li>The help panel (ie the window you're looking at now) doesn't respond to
the font selected in preferences.

<br><li>Additional frames that are open when vjcontrol's look & feel are 
changed don't adopt the new look and feel. (The help panel never changes look & feel).

<br><li>Some menu items don't respond to font changes.

<br><li>No matter what you do, <b>DO NOT</b> click on the word <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~pyre/area.html">crotch</a>.
