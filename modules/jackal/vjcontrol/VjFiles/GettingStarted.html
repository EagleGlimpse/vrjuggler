Welcome to VR Juggler VjControl 1.0!

<p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
If you're reading this from the VjControl help menu, you've probably done
this already, but if not, these are the steps that need to be taken before
using VjControl:

<ol>
<li>Set your <tt>VJ_BASE_DIR</tt> environment variable to the directory where VR Juggler is installed.
<li>Create a directory called <tt>.vjconfig</tt> in your home directory.
This is where VjControl will store its own configuration information, and is a good general place to store all your Juggler-related configuration files.
<li>You should add the directory <tt>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/bin</tt> to your <tt>$PATH</tt>.
<li>Make sure that Java v1.2 is installed on your machine.  Make sure that the directory where the <tt>java</tt> executable resides is also in your <tt>$PATH</tt>.  (see below for instructions on using VjControl with jdk1.1).
<li>If you have been provided with a <tt>vjcontrol.cfg</tt> file, copy it into
the <tt>~/.vjconfig</tt> directory.
</ol>

<h3>Starting VjControl</h3>

Simply type <tt>vjcontrol</tt>, and the VjControl program will start up
without any files loaded.  Once it's running, VjControl can be configured to 
load certain files at startup on subsequent executions.  There are also 
command-line arguments that can be used to load files at startup.

<h3>Loading Files</h3>

VR Juggler uses two types of files: <i>Config Files</i> and <i>ChunkDesc Files</i>.

<ul>
<li><i>Config Files</i> are made of 'Chunks' of information.  For example,
one chunk will describe the setup of a display device while another will
describe the setup for a keyboard or tracking system.  There will typically
be several readymade config files in the <tt>$VJ_BASE_DIR/Data</tt> directory,
with names like <tt>config.simulator</tt> or <tt>config.2wall</tt>.

<li><i>ChunkDesc Files</i> define the different kinds of chunks (ie. what kind
of information a Keyboard chunk should have, or a Display chunk).  The main
ChunkDesc file for VR Juggler is usually <tt>$VJ_BASE_DIR/Data/chunksDesc</tt>.
</ul>

To load a Config or ChunkDesc file, click on the "Configure" or "Descriptions"
tabs of the VjControl GUI, and then press the "Load" button.

<h3>Using VjControl with java 1.1</h3>
Version 1.2 of Sun's JDK has been available for several months, but some
platforms are still laggin on porting and deploying it.  It is possible
to run VjControl on a system with the older JDK 1.1 installed, with a little
bit of work.

<p>First, you need to download and install the Java Foundation Classes (Swing 
classes) for JDK 1.1.  Pay particular attention to the location of the
file "swingall.jar".

<p>The $VJ_BASE_DIR/bin directory contains script called vjcontrol.jdk11
which will start up vjcontrol on systems with JDK1.1 and Swing.  You may
need to edit the script file to make sure the paths used for classes.zip
and swingall.jar are correct.
