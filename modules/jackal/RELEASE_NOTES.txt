 Version: 0.0.1 (dev build)
Started: September 5, 2001

    Separated Jackal (Juggler Application Control and Configuration Library)
    from VR Juggler core.  It includes the following basic features:

        * Configuration file system, using XML-based data files that are
          parsed into ConfigChunks and ChunkDescs.

        * The Jackal Server, which can be added to an appliation to provide
          network-based monitoring and reconfiguration.

        * VjControl, client application for the Jackal Server.  VjControl is
          an extensible, componentized Java application.

        * Dynamic reconfiguration support code, imported from VR Juggler 
          Kernel, which allows the Jackal Server to reconfigure a running
          application in response to commands from VjControl.

        * Performance measurement library, which allows applications to
          timestamp parts of their source code.  The Jackal Server can
          write performance measurement information to a log file or send
          it across the network to VjControl.

    Jackal has the following external dependencies:

        * Vapor (VR Juggler Portable Runtime) version 0.4.  See
          www.vrjuggler.org for information.

        * Xerces-c 1.5 or better. See xml.apache.org for information.

        * Java Development Kit 1.2 or better.  See java.sun.com.

        * JAXP (Java API for XML Processing).  Included with JDK1.4;
          or see java.sun.com.
