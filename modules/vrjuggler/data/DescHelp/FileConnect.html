<h2>File Connection Chunk</h2>

The <b>File Connection</b> chunk (token "FileConnect") defines an output
(or, in the future, input) file for the VR Juggler Environment Manager.
Its most common use is to define a file which can be used as a destination
for performance measurement data.

<p>
The <b>File Name</b> property gives the pathname for this file.  Exactly
what constitutes a valid name depends on the underlying filesystem.  On
Unix systems, this might be something like "output_data" or 
"~cjust/tmp/perfdata.txt".

<p>
<b>Enabled</b> lets you turn this particular file on or off.  If Enabled is
false, Juggler will not open the file and won't write anything to it.

<p>
<b>Readable.</b> Currently, this should always be false.  Internally,
Juggler has some ability to read instructions from files or pipes.  In the
future, this may allow the use of input instruction files.
