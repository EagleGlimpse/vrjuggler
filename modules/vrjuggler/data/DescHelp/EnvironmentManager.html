<h2>Environment Manager Chunk</h2>

The Environment Manager is the part of a VR Juggler application which connects
to outside control and data-gathering programs, most notably the VjControl 
configuration editor.
<p>
The Environment Manager chunk (token: "EnvironmentManager") configures the 
network settings for the Environment Manager and controls which features
are activated.

<p>
The <b>Port</b> field tells VR Juggler what network port to listen for connections
on.  A reasonable default value is port 4450.

<p>
The <b>Accept Connections</b> field tells VR Juggler whether or not it should
open the network port and accept connections.  If this is set to false,
VjControl will be unable to connect to the Juggler application.

<p>
<b>Performance Target</b>.  This field tells Juggler where to send the performance
data it gathers.  The result is either a <a href="FileConnect.html">File
Connection</a> or a Network Connection.  Note that currently the Network
Connection is not fully implemented.
