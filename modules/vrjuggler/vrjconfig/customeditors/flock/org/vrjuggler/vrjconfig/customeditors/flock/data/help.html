   <h2>Flock of Birds configuration steps:</h2>

   <ol>
      <li>
         Set the serial port to which the Flock of Birds is connected.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the baud for the serial port.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the hemisphere of the transmitter within which the user(s) will
         be operating.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the Fast Bird Bus (FBB) address of the master bird.  This is
         determined by the DIP switch settings on the birds.  With EPROM
         version 3.67 or newer, this value will be detected automatically by
         the device driver.  Otherwise, it must be set correctly here.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the addressing mode.  This will depend on the type of Flock
         hardware being used.  With EPROM verrsion 3.67 or newer, this value
         will be detected automatically by the device driver.  Otherwise, it
         must be set correctly here.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the filter.  This value is currently <i>ignored</i> by the device
         driver.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the physical units of the data returned by the sensors.
         Currently, the Flock of Birds tracking system <i>only</i> returns
         inches, but the device driver always reinterprets this as
         <b>Feet</b>.  Therefore, <b>Feet</b> must be chosen.
      </li>
      <li>
         Configure the position and orientation of the MotionStar Wireless
         transmitter (the large black box) relative to the VR Juggler
         coordinate frame.  This process configures what is known as a
         "position transform filter."  The panels titled "Orientation" and
         "Position" present an easy way to perform this task.

         <p>
            Configuring the position filter involves ...
