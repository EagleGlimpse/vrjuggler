- fix reconfiguration (startup/shutdown/startup) of AudioWorks
  - currently fails
- fix reconfiguration (startup/shutdown/startup) of OpenAL
  - succeeds, but sounds cannot play after this.

- fill in the implementaion that allows the soundAPI state to be configured
  - make sure this state is transferred when an API is changed to another.

- respect whether a sound is retriggerable

- support for streaming audio
- DSP plugins (maybe?) streaming audio might work with this.
