DATE       AUTHOR      CHANGE
---------- ----------- --------------------------------------------------------
2002-08-02 patrickh    Developer installations are now constructed using the
                       standard installation targets.
2002-08-02 patrickh    Refactored the tweek::SubjectManager interface and the
                       C++ implementation to allow users to add customized
                       identifying elements to their Subject Manager instance.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.8.0
2002-08-01 patrickh    Enabled compiling of profiled libraries.
2002-07-14 patrickh    Extended org.vrjuggler.tweek.beans.FileLoader to include
                       a method for indicating that the user wants to save an
                       open file with a different name (a "Save As ..."-type
                       option).
                       NEW VERSION: 0.6.1
2002-07-14 patrickh    org.vrjuggler.tweek.gui.MessagePanel is no longer a
                       singleton.  Further, it now uses a custom document,
                       org.vrjuggler.tweek.text.MessageDocument, an
                       instance of which is held by the TweekCore singleton.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.6.0
2002-07-13 patrickh    Added a new command-line option, --validate, that
                       directs the XML loader to validate XML beanlist
                       documents against the XML Schema that describes them.
2002-07-05 nonchocoboy Added support for programmtic focusing of PanelBeans in
                       BeanModelViewers. The --defaultbean command-line
                       argument has been added.
2002-07-03 patrickh    Subject Manager servants are now named using a GUID to
                       guarantee automatic uniqueness without using a special
                       naming context.  The tweek::SubjectManager interface 
                       has been extended to provide clients with additional
                       instance-specific information about a given reference.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.5.0
2002-06-24 patrickh    The tweek-config script is now written in Perl.  It is
                       capable of determining its installation path at runtime.
2002-05-09 nonchocoboy The Bean XML files now name the Bean class rather than
                       the JAR file entry.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.4.0
2002-04-29 patrickh    Support for plugging in Java and C++ ORBs at
                       configuration time has been improved.  OpenORB and
                       omniORB 3 are still the default implementations, but it
                       is easier to use different ORBs.
2002-02-12 patrickh    The Icon Viewer now uses buttons instead of labels for
                       its icons.  This makes it much more clear when a mouse
                       click is actually being processed.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.3.1
2002-02-09 patrickh    Added support for context-specific file opening and
                       closing.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.3.0
2002-02-05 patrickh    Added support for editing Bean-specific preferences.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.2.0
2002-01-22 patrickh    Started a test suite for the Java code using JUnit.
2001-12-09 patrickh    Added the capability to "unregister" subjects previously
                       registered with the Subject Manager.
2001-11-20 patrickh    Created two new Java API libraries: TweekServices.jar
                       and TweekEvents.jar.
2001-11-18 patrickh    Added the ability to request all subjects currently
                       registered with a tweek::SubjectManager.
2001-11-18 patrickh    Changed the use of tweek::SubjectManagerImpl so that
                       there is one associated with each tweek::CorbaManager
                       instance rather than one per memory space.
2001-11-13 patrickh    Encourage the use of OpenORB over JDK 1.4 so that this
                       software can be used with JDK 1.2 and 1.3.
