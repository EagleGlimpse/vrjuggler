2002-02-12 patrickh The Icon Viewer now uses buttons instead of labels for its
                    icons.  This makes it much more clear when a mouse click
                    is actually being processed.
                    NEW VERSION: 0.3.1
2002-02-09 patrickh Added support for context-specific file opening and
                    closing.

                    registered with a tweek::SubjectManager.
2001-11-18 patrickh Changed the use of tweek::SubjectManagerImpl so that there
                    is one associated with each tweek::CorbaManager instance
                    rather than one per memory space.
2001-11-13 patrickh Encourage the use of OpenORB over JDK 1.4 so that this
                    software can be used with JDK 1.2 and 1.3.
