2001-11-18 patrickh Changed the use of tweek::SubjectManagerImpl so that there
                    is one associated with each tweek::CorbaManager instance
                    rather than one per memory space.
2001-11-13 patrickh Encourage the use of OpenORB over JDK 1.4 so that this
                    software can be used with JDK 1.2 and 1.3.
